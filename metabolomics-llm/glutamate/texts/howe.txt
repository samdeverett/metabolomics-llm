ABSTRACT
Metabolomic profiling of nine trained ultramarathon runners completing
an 80.5 km self-paced treadmill-based time trial was carried out.
Plasma samples were obtained from venous whole blood, collected at
rest and on completion of the distance (post-80.5 km). The samples
were analyzed by using high-resolution mass spectrometry in
combination with both hydrophilic interaction (HILIC) and reversed
phase (RP) chromatography. The extracted putatively identified
features were modeled using Simca P 14.1 software (Umetrics, Umea,
Sweden). A large number of amino acids decreased post-80.5 km and
fatty acid metabolism was affected with an increase in the formation
of medium-chain unsaturated and partially oxidized fatty acids and
conjugates of fatty acids with carnitines. A possible explanation for
the complex pattern of medium-chain and oxidized fatty acids formed is
that the prolonged exercise provoked the proliferation of peroxisomes.
The peroxisomes may provide a readily utilizable form of energy
through formation of acetyl carnitine and other acyl carnitines for
export to mitochondria in the muscles; and secondly may serve to
regulate the levels of oxidized metabolites of long-chain fatty acids.
This is the first study to provide evidence of the metabolic profile
in response to prolonged ultramarathon running using an untargeted
approach. The findings provide an insight to the effects of
ultramarathon running on the metabolic specificities and alterations
that may demonstrate cardio-protective effects.

1. INTRODUCTION
There has been an upward trend in life expectancy over the past few
years in developed countries, but lifestyle risks still pose real
challenges to longevity. These risks factors include obesity,
unhealthy diet, cigarette smoking, sedentary lifestyle, and alcohol
consumption  1 . Regular physical activity, coupled with a healthy
balanced diet and moderate to no alcohol consumption, can
significantly decrease the impact of these risk factors resulting in
an increased life expectancy  2 . For instance, it has been reported
that regular exercise attenuates sarcopenia and promotes
cardiovascular health  3,4,5  as well as being prescribed for
individuals with diabetes  6 , obesity, and mild to moderate
depression  5 . Moreover, it has been reported that incidences of
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes decrease with the
frequency of participation in marathons independent of the total
distance run annually, but this might be due to longer training runs
or genetic and innate differences between endurance trained marathon
runners and those who are not  7 . It has been reported that compared
to the general population ultra-endurance athletes have missed fewer
work/school days through illness and injury and have overall lower
incidences of chronic disease  8 . Although it has been suggested that
sustained exercise such as ultra-marathon running may cause adverse
cardiovascular effects  9 , some studies suggest that chronic
ultra-endurance training may attenuate biological ageing  10,11 .
The rising popularity of ultramarathon running over the past few years
has seen non-professional runners striving for bigger and tougher
extreme physical challenges  8,12,13 . An ultramarathon is considered
anything beyond a traditional marathon distance (42.2 km) with the
majority of races being 80.5 km or more  12,14,15,16,17 . Of
particular interest, is the increase in participation of runners with
less than three years of regular running experience (25%) from the
point of taking part in their first ultra-distance event  8 . Such
extreme endurance events place a great deal of physiological and
psychological demands on the body and with this increase in
participation, and though it is perceived participants of such
endurances, appear fit and healthy, there have been occasional reports
of severe complications following ultra-endurance exercise and concern
of harmful effects on health such as cardiac damage  9,18 .
Ultramarathon runners place themselves at the risk of extreme fatigue,
exhaustion and test their own personal limits  19 . Therefore,
understanding the effects and implications of ultramarathon events is
needed and the ultramarathon runners profile provides a unique model
to investigate the physiological responses to prolonged physical
exertion.
Ultra–endurance athletes push themselves beyond ordinary limits
 20 , with prolonged endurance exercise, eliciting extreme metabolic
stress, inducing metabolic changes such as metabolite accumulation
 21  muscle glycogen depletion  22,23 , and fat oxidation  24 .
Currently, data on the metabolomic alterations that occur during
exercise are still limited. A previous study of healthy adults
subjected to submaximal exercise showed significant increases in a
range of purine metabolites and several acyl carnitines  25 .
Understanding of such metabolic changes could enable the elucidation
of individual’s ability to maintain peak performance and
physiological function  20 .
When looking at the traditional marathon, physical performance can be
affected by gender  26,27,28 , age  29 , lifestyle, and body mass
index (BMI)  30 , through differences in physiological (e.g., muscle
strength, oxygen carrying capacity) and morphological (e.g.,
percentage of body fat, muscle mass) characteristics of an individual
 31 . However, the amount of exercise optimal for a given individual
remains unknown due to absence of definitive data on the molecular
mechanisms underlying exercise in relation to health, particularly
regarding ultra-endurance distances. Therefore, investigation of the
metabolomic effect of exercise on the human metabolome could provide
insights into phenotypic responses, permit development of personalized
training regimes based on initial metabolic status of an individual
 32 , and yield vital diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for use by
physicians in the management of cardiovascular and other related
diseases  33 .
The aim of the current study was to analyze the change in metabolic
profile of trained ultramarathon runners in response to an 80.5 km
simulated treadmill ultramarathon in a controlled laboratory
environment. Plasma samples were analyzed for their metabolomic
profiles to determine the metabolic changes due to extreme exercise in
order gain some insight into how metabolism is adapted for endurance
performance.
2. RESULTS
2.1. PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE TO THE ULTRAMARATHON
Nine male participant runners (mean age 34 ± 7 years, V˙O2max 61.6
± 4.3 mL/min/kg) completed the time trial in 9 h:17 min:18 s ± 1
h:18 min:24 s. The fastest time to complete was 7 h:4 min:9 s and the
longest time to complete was 10 h:37 min:37 s with an average V˙O2max
as percentage of maximum (64.5 ± 3.8%).
2.2. VARIATION OF METABOLIC PROFILE WITH EXERCISE
Principal component analysis (PCA) of the HILIC data showed clear
separation between the pre- and post-80.5 km samples (Figure 1). The
data set of 542 polar metabolites was filtered by excluding 96
metabolites which had relative standard deviation (RSD) values >20%
within the pooled samples. Figure 1 shows a clear separation of the
pre- and post 80.5 km samples according to principial component
analysis (PCA) based on 446 metabolites annotated to Metabolomics
Standards Initiative (MSI) levels 2/1  34 , where level 2 consisted of
mass matching to <3 ppm to a metabolite in the database and level 1
consisted of mass matching to <3 ppm and a retention time
corresponding to a standard. The pooled samples (P) clustered in the
middle of the plot indicating reasonable technical stability
throughout the run (Figure 1, P1–6) but they indicated some drift
which may account to some of the variation between individuals. There
was a technical problem with one of the post-80.5 km samples which was
removed from the plot (total post 80.5 km _n_ = 8). The model
explained 82.6% of the variation in the data in principal component
analysis score plot (PC1 and PC2). From Figure 1 it can be seen that
ultramarathon running has a strong impact on the levels of polar
metabolites in plasma although there is considerable variation between
with individuals with regard to their response. The data for the 500
lipophilic metabolites was filtered by excluding 200 metabolites which
had RSD >20% in the pooled samples. The PCA model shown in Figure 2 is
based on 300 metabolites annotated to MSI level 2. The model explains
80.7% of the variation in the data in two components. It is not as
strong as the model based on polar metabolites and pre-80.5 km samples
C2 and E2 are outliers taken from the same individual. Figure S1 shows
that there was no separation between two baseline samples one having
been taken prior to the day of the run for a model based on the polar
metabolites. Figure S2 shows that there was no clear separation
between the two sets of baseline samples although again sample B1 is
an outlier for the same individual who produced outliers in Figure 2.
Figures S3–S80 show comparisons of the absolute response in pre-80.5
km and post-80.5 km for selected metabolites using bar graphs along
with comparison of these metabolites in baseline and pre-80.5 km. It
is clear that the marked shifts in metabolite levels between the
pre-80.5 km and post-80.5 km samples are absent when baseline and
pre-80.5 km samples are compared. The only metabolites that show some
change between baseline and post-80.5 km are bile acids. We observed
previously that bile acids show some diurnal variation  25 .

Pareto scaled.
2.3. UNIVARIATE COMPARISONS
As can be seen in Table 1 there were a very large number of metabolic
changes resulting from the bout of ultramarathon running, with many
amino acids decreasing in abundance while there were increases in the
levels of many acylcarnitines, fatty acids and oxidized fatty acids.
In many cases, the findings are significant for the comparison of the
pre- and post-80.5 km samples and a false discovery rate (FDR) test
confirmed the significance to all metabolites with _p_ < 0.05  35 . In
order to gain a comprehensive overview, analysis was also carried out
by RP chromatography, which was useful for getting a clearer picture
of the lipophilic compounds in plasma including long-chain
acylcarnitines, fatty acids and oxidized fatty acids. The results from
the RP analysis of acylcarnitines, fatty acids and oxidized fatty
acids are also shown in Table 1. The RP mode was better for these
classes of compounds since in HILIC mode they all eluted close to the
column void volume. Table S1 shows the metabolites, which were matched
against a standard. Table S2 shows a list of the standards that were
run in five standard mixtures plus a mixture of free fatty acids
derived from two fixed oils, olive oil and cod liver oil.

3. DISCUSSION
The aim of the current study was to determine an untargeted metabolic
response to an 80.5 km treadmill-based ultramarathon. The observed
clear separation between baseline samples (pre 80.5 km) and samples
taken immediately on completion of the distance (post 80.5 km) with
the use of a PCA model demonstrated that there were significant
metabolic changes induced by the extreme exercise of ultramarathon
running. For some metabolites, the changes were very large and were
highly significant when the two cohorts were compared (Table 1). The
major changes concern fatty acid metabolism, with a large elevation in
acylcarnitine levels in plasma for a wide range of these compounds.
The impact of exercise on carnitines has been observed before in a
number of studies  36,37,38,39,40 . A possible explanation is that the
carnitines reflect mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation as an energy
source under the impact of exercise. This is of interest since
acylcarnitine accumulation has been identified during prolonged
fasting and similar increased demands on stored energy  39  would be
expected in an ultra-marathon event. The elevations in fatty acids are
supported by previous findings  41  where it was demonstrated that
elevated rates of fat oxidation and ability to maintain glycogen
concentrations were found in highly trained ultra-endurance athletes.
It was shown in the metabolic response to a 24 h ultra-marathon run
that there was an increased lipid profile with substrate utilization
shift towards fat oxidation  24  suggesting reduction in
cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk  42 . More recently it has been
hypothesized that acyl carnitines have neuroactive properties that can
regulate exertion via interaction with the neurons regulating muscle
activity  40 . Less frequently studied are the products of fatty acid
oxidation that accumulate in plasma during exercise  43,44 . Many
oxidized fatty acids have potent effects on blood vessels promoting
either vasodilation or vasoconstriction  45 . As observed (Table 1 and
Figure S81) there is a complex mixture of fatty acids all of which are
greatly elevated in plasma following exercise. The oxidation products
of linoleic acid 9-hydroxylinoleic acid and 13-hydroxylinoleic acid
have been proposed as markers of oxidative stress following exercise
and several isomers of hydroxylinoleic acids were elevated in the
post-80.5 km samples in comparison to baseline (Table 1). This
supports the findings of previous studies that have demonstrated
ultra-endurance exercise-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production  46 . Figure S81 shows extracted ion chromatograms for the
pre- and post- levels of oxidized octadecadienoic acid. The range of
oxidized fatty acids elevated post-exercise is extensive and the
increases very marked (Table 1), therefore the elevation of
hydroxyoctadecadienoicacids is not exclusive and there are many other
hydroxy acids which are elevated post-exercise plus some dioic acids.
Whether or not these acids also have biological activities is unknown,
as is the precise reason for their elevation. When the heat map
(Figure 3) is considered it is evident that many of the oxidized fatty
acids, although elevated (Table 1), are of relatively low abundance.
It has been suggested that oxidized acids are a marker of oxidative
stress  43,44  but it might be expected that other readily oxidized
acids present in plasma, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), might
also be oxidized in the same way, but despite EPA being relatively
abundant in the plasma, no peaks for hydroxy EPAs can be seen.
Therefore, it is possible that there is some biological mechanism that
keeps oxidation products of EPA at low levels since many of these
metabolites have potent anti-inflammatory and vasoactive effects  47 .
Although oxidative stress was not measured in the current study,
previous studies have demonstrated ultra-marathon running induces
reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and markers of oxidative
damage  48  and this warrants further investigation.

Given the wide range of unsaturated fatty acids and hydroxylated fatty
acids (Table 1) it would seem likely that these compounds arise from
peroxisomal metabolism and this might provide a protective mechanism
for ensuring that the levels of oxidized long-chain unsaturated acids
are kept at low levels. Peroxisomes are known to be responsible for
degrading prostaglandins  49 . Unlike mitochondrial beta-oxidation of
fatty acids, peroxisomal beta-oxidation of fatty acids does not
necessarily go to completion and acids may only be shortened by 3–4
cycles of 2 carbon chain shortening  49  yielding a molecule of acetyl
CoA/acetyl carnitine at each cycle. For instance, it might be
significant that hexadecadienoic acid, tetradecadienoic acid and
dodecadiencoic acid are all elevated, these are not abundant naturally
occurring fatty acids, but they are all products of chain shortening
of linoleic acid via beta-oxidation  49 . Similarly, hexdecatrienoic
acid could arise from chain shortening of linolenic acid via one
beta-oxidation step. The reason for the metabolism pausing when a
double bond is encountered within the fatty acid chain is that at this
point further metabolism requires the commitment of nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide phosphate, (NADPH) in the reduction of the double
bond before further chain shortening can occur  49 . Under conditions
of aerobic stress there will be generally a high requirement for NADPH
in countering oxidative stress; it is required for instance in the
recycling of glutathione disulfide back to glutathione. The elevated
levels of acylcarnitines are consistent with increased beta-oxidation
of fatty acids by peroxisomes since they are the major product
exported out of peroxisomes resulting from fatty acid beta-oxidation.
It has previously been demonstrated that physical exercise increases
peroxisome levels in rat heart  50 . Acetyl carnitine is readily
utilized by mitochondria as a source of acetyl CoA, which can be
metabolized via the Krebs cycle. The major question with regard to
carnitines is; are they waste products or utilizable as substrates for
further oxidation? Conversion of acylCoAs to acylcarnitines is
necessary in order to preserve free levels of CoA within the
mitochondria  51 . The heat map (Figure 3) indicates in terms of
absolute abundance that the common dietary fatty acids are much higher
in plasma than the unusual acids, which are promoted by exercise
observed in the current study. Thus, it seems probable that medium
chain length unsaturated fatty acids are minor metabolites due to
partial metabolism of long-chain unsaturated fatty acids by
peroxisomes providing an additional source of acetylcarnitine for
export to mitochondria. The heat map (Figure 4) shows the relative
abundance of the 40 most abundant acyl carnitines in plasma. Acetyl
carnitine is highly abundant while the carnitines corresponding to the
medium-chain fatty acids are of much lower abundance. Although the
levels of some acyl carnitines rise in urine post-exercise they do not
increase to the same extent as the plasma levels in the current study
and no increase in post-exercise urinary acetyl carnitine was observed
previously  25 . This suggests that the carnitines may be produced for
utilization as energy substrates. Conversion of free fatty acids to
acyl CoAs requires the investment of a molecule of adenosine
triphosphate (ATP). However, acyl carnitines are an activated form of
fatty acid substrate and are convertible into acyl CoAs without the
investment of ATP in creating the thioester bond and thus they can be
taken up into mitochondria and further metabolized  51,52 .

samples and two post-exercise samples. Red = highest value (2.6 ×
107), Yellow = 5 × 104 and blue = 5 × 103.
Therefore, the pattern of fatty acids and carnitines observed in the
current study points strongly towards a large increase in peroxisomal
metabolism. For example, a widely studied substrate of peroxisomal
metabolism is phytanic acid, which is present in dairy products  50 .
This compound undergoes α-oxidation in the peroxisomes producing
pristanic acid, which is then further metabolized by the peroxisomes
yielding propanolyl CoA (carnitine) and dimethyl nonanoyl CoA
(undecanoyl carnitine) after six cycles of beta oxidation. Both of
these carnitines are elevated in the post-80.5 km samples and provide
potential substrates for mitochondrial metabolism in the muscles.
The increased activity of the peroxisomes is further underlined by
elevated levels of some dioic acids (Table 1), which are also only
produced by peroxisomes. The hypothesis that the metabolite patterns
are consistent with peroxisomal proliferation is consistent with our
earlier observations where it was proposed that exercise increased the
proliferation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ
ligands in plasma  53 . From the current study, these ligands might
well be long-chain unsaturated fatty acids, which are substrates for
peroxisomal metabolism as discussed above.
The levels of almost all the amino acids in the plasma samples
decreased significantly. The fall in the amino acids used in protein
biosynthesis might be due to an increase in protein biosynthesis
during exercise, which was observed to occur  54,55 . Hydrocortisone
is responsible for maintaining a homeostasis under stress conditions,
in this study both hydrocortisone and its metabolite urocortisone are
increased and this was observed to occur in previous studies  56,57 .
The most studied metabolites with regard to the effect of exercise and
the determination of fitness are metabolites in the purine pathway
such as hypoxanthine and inosine; a marked change in levels of
hypoxanthine was observed in the present study. The re-uptake of
hypoxanthine into muscle was observed to be more efficient in highly
trained individuals  58  and the elevation of hypoxanthine in plasma
during exercise is less marked than we observed in urine samples taken
post-exercise  25 . However, since the athletes in the current study
were trained, it might be expected that their metabolism be geared to
conserving purines  59 . Future research is also warranted to
determine the long-term adaptations to ultramarathon training. Changes
in uridine following exercise have been observed previously and most
often increases have been observed, in the current case there was a
marked decrease  60 . Changes in tocopherols have also been observed
previously in exercise studies and γ-tocopherol has been correlated
to V˙O2max level  37 . In summary, many amino acids were lowered in
plasma post-exercise but the clearest impact of endurance exercise is
on fatty acid metabolism but with respect to formation of medium-chain
unsaturated and partially oxidized fatty acids and conjugates of fatty
acids with carnitines. Many of these metabolites were increased
several fold. The most likely explanation for the complex pattern of
medium-chain and oxidized fatty acids formed is that the prolonged
exercise provoked the proliferation of peroxisomes. The peroxisomes
may serve two functions, one of providing a readily utilizable form of
energy through formation of acetyl carnitine and other acyl carnitines
for export to mitochondria in the muscles; which can utilize these
substrates without investment of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
required to conjugate free fatty acids to acetyl-Coenzyme-A. Secondly
the peroxisomes may serve to regulate the levels of oxidized
metabolites of long-chain fatty acids since many of these metabolites
can provoke biological responses such as vasoconstriction or have
pro-inflammatory activity.
To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to provide
evidence of the metabolic profile in response to prolonged
ultramarathon running using an untargeted approach. The findings
provide an insight to the effects of ultramarathon running on the
metabolic specificities and alterations that may demonstrate
cardio-protective effects.
4. MATERIALS AND METHODS
4.1. CHEMICALS AND SOLVENTS
High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade Acetonitrile (ACN)
was purchased from Fisher Scientific (Loughborough, UK) and HPLC grade
water was produced by a Direct-Q3 UltrapureWater System (Millipore,
Watford, UK). AnalaR-grade formic acid (98%) was obtained from
BDH-Merck (Poole, UK). Authentic stock standard metabolites
(Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK) were prepared as previously described  61 
and diluted four times with ACN LC-MS analysis of the four mixtures of
standards (Table S2). Mixtures of fatty acid standards were derived
from the hydrolysis of olive oil and cod liver oil with 1 M ethanolic
KOH. These oils have well defined fatty acid compositions  62 .
Ammonium acetate was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Poole, UK).
4.2. PARTICIPANTS
Nine healthy trained male participants (mean ± SD) age 34 ± 7 years,
V˙O2max 61.6 ± 4.3 mL/min/kg, body mass 70.4 ± 6.6 kg, stature
178.3 ± 3 cm, body mass index 22.1 ± 1.7 kg/m2 were voluntarily
recruited and provided written informed consent. Ethical approval was
obtained from Kingston University Faculty Ethics Committee and was
conducted in accordance to the declaration of Helsinki. All
participants reported no illness or infection in the two weeks leading
up to the trial. Participants had on average 5.3 years’ (range
1–25 years) experience in ultra-endurance exercise.
4.3. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
The study was a cross-sectional observational time-trial conducted at
Kingston University London Human Performance Lab and all testing
commenced at 07:00 ± 1:00 h. Food and drink was provided ad libitum
during the entire duration and self-selected according to the
participants preference to replicate habitual ultra-running
conditions, but was not considered in the current analysis. However,
further analysis of food and fluid consumption may be warranted in
further investigations. Participants were asked to refrain from
exercise and the consumption of alcohol 24 h prior to commencement of
the exercise trial, however were not required to be fasted to
replicate habitual ultra-marathon running conditions.
Plasma samples collected before (pre-80.5 km), and immediately after
completion of the distance (post-80.5 km) were analyzed for their
metabolomic profiles using both HILIC and RPLC-MS methods.
4.4. BLOOD SAMPLING
Plasma samples were obtained from venous whole blood collected via
venepuncture at rest before commencement of the trial (pre-80.5 km)
and on completion of the distance (post-80.5 km). An additional 3 h
fasted blood sample (baseline) was also collected at rest from all
participants two weeks prior to the 80.5 km trial. This was to enable
comparison between baseline (B) and pre-80.5 km (C) samples to
validate that the changes seen were in response to the exercise trial
(Supplementary Materials Figures S1 and S2). Participants rested in a
supine position for 10 min before blood sampling at rest, and supine
position immediately on completion of the trial. Blood samples were
collected by venepuncture from an antecubital vein of the forearm
using EDTA vacutainers (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Plymouth, UK).
Blood samples were immediately centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 _g_ at 4
°C and plasma aliquots stored at −80 °C for subsequent analysis.
4.5. SAMPLE PREPARATION
Exactly 100 µL of plasma was mixed with 400 µL of acetonitrile
containing 5 µg/mL of 13C2 glycine (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK) as an
internal standard to ensure retention time stability, and then
centrifuged for 10 min before transferring into a vial with an insert.
The pooled sample was prepared by pipetting 50 µL from each of the 46
samples and then mixing them together before being diluting 0.2 mL of
the pooled sample with 0.8 mL of acetonitrile containing 5 µg/mL 13C2
glycine internal standard followed by centrifuging. Additionally, the
prepared mixtures of authentic standard metabolites  61  containing 5
µg/mL of 13C2 glycine as internal standard were run.
4.6. LC-MS CONDITIONS
Liquid chromatographic separation was carried out on an Accela HPLC
system interfaced to an Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) using both a ZIC-pHILIC column
(150 × 4.6 mm, 5 µm, HiChrom, Reading, UK) and a reversed phase
column (ACE C4, 150 × 3.0 mm, 3 µm, HiChrom, Reading, UK). The
metabolites were eluted from the ZICpHILIC column with a mobile phase
consisting of 20 mM ammonium carbonate in HPLC-grade water (solvent A)
and acetonitrile (solvent B), at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. The
elution gradient was an A:B ratio of 20:80 at 0 min, 80:20 at 30 min,
92:8 at 35 min and finally 20:80 at 45 min. The mobile phase for
elution of the ACE C4 column consisted of 1 mM acetic acid in water
(A) and 1 mM acetic acid in acetonitrile (B), at a flow rate of 0.4
mL/min. The elution gradient was as follows: A:B ratio 60:40 at 0 min,
0:100 at 30 min, 0:100 at 36 min, 60:40 at 37 min, 60:40 at 41 min.
The nitrogen sheath and auxiliary gas flow rates were maintained at 50
and 17 arbitrary units. The electrospray ionization (ESI) interface
was operated in both positive and negative modes. The spray voltage
was 4.5 kV for positive mode and 4.0 kV for negative mode, while the
ion transfer capillary temperature was 275 °C. Full scan data were
obtained in the mass-to-charge range of 75 to 1200 amu for both
ionization modes. The MS system fully calibrated prior to running
according to manufacturer’s guidelines. The resulting data were
acquired using the XCalibur 2.1.0 software package (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Bremen, Germany). The samples were run pairwise with two
pooled samples being run at the beginning two after ten samples and

The data was extracted by using MZ Match software
(http://mzmatch.sourceforge.net/)  63  and the identification of
putative metabolites was made via the macro-enabled Excel file, Ideom
(http://mzmatch.sourceforge.net/ideom.html). The lists of the
metabolites obtained from these searches were then carefully evaluated
manually by considering the quality of their peaks and their retention
time match with the standard metabolite mixtures run in the same
sequence. All reported metabolites were within 3 ppm of their exact
masses. Statistical analyses were performed using both univariate with
Microsoft Excel and multivariate approaches using SIMCA-P software
version 14.1 (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden). All subsequent metabolite
responses were compared by paired _t_-test using Microsoft Excel in
order to indicate significant differences, where _p_ < 0.05.
Multivariate data analysis was employed with SIMCA by fitting PCA-X
models having refined the metabolite lists by removing metabolites
with RSD values >20% in the pooled samples.
5. CONCLUSIONS
The clearest impact of endurance exercise is on fatty acid metabolism
but with respect to formation of medium-chain unsaturated and
partially oxidized fatty acids and conjugates of fatty acids with
carnitines. The most likely explanation for the complex pattern of
medium-chain and oxidized fatty acids formed is that the ultramarathon
provoked the proliferation of peroxisomes. The peroxisomes may serve
two functions, one of providing a readily utilizable from of energy in
the form of acetyl carnitine and other acyl carnitines for export to
mitochondria in the muscles, without the investment of the ATP
required to conjugate free fatty acids to CoA. Secondly the
peroxisomes may serve to regulate the levels of oxidized metabolites
of long-chain fatty acids since many of these metabolites can provoke
biological responses such as vasoconstriction or have pro-inflammatory
activity. This is the first study using an untargeted metabolomics
approach to determine the metabolic profile in response to
ultramarathon running. The findings provide an insight to the effects
of ultramarathon distance running on the metabolic specificities and
alterations that may demonstrate cardio-protective effects.
