Abstract
High intensity exercise (HIE) stimulates greater physiological remodeling when compared to workload matched low-moderate intensity exercise. This study utilized an untargeted metabolomics approach to examine the metabolic perturbations that occur following two workload matched supramaximal low volume HIE trials. In a randomized order, 7 untrained males completed two exercise protocols separated by 1 week; (1) HIE150 %: 30 × 20 s cycling at 150 % VO2peak, 40 s passive rest; (2) HIE300 %: 30 × 10 s cycling at 300 % VO2peak, 50 s passive rest. Total exercise duration was 30 min for both trials. Blood samples were taken at rest, during and immediately following exercise and at 60 min post exercise. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of plasma identified 43 known metabolites of which 3 demonstrated significant fold changes (HIE300 % compared to the HIE150 % value) during exercise, 14 post exercise and 23 at the end of the recovery period. Significant changes in plasma metabolites relating to lipid metabolism [fatty acids: dodecanoate (p = 0.042), hexadecanoate (p = 0.001), octadecanoate (p = 0.001)], total cholesterol (p = 0.001), and glycolysis [lactate (p = 0.018)] were observed following exercise and during the recovery period. The HIE300 % protocol elicited greater metabolic changes relating to lipid metabolism and glycolysis when compared to HIE150 % protocol. These changes were more pronounced throughout the recovery period rather than during the exercise bout itself. Data from the current study demonstrate the use of metabolomics to monitor intensity-dependent changes in multiple metabolic pathways following exercise. The small sample size indicates a need for further studies in a larger sample cohort to validate these findings.

1 Introduction
High intensity exercise (HIE), defined as exercise performed at ≥80 % of an individual’s VO2max (Romijn et al. 1993), has gained increasing popularity. One reason for its popularity, especially in a time poor society, is the numerous health and fitness benefits that can be obtained from performing short bouts of exercise, albeit at a higher intensity (Gibala et al. 2012). Previous work has shown that when total workload is matched while exercise intensity (HIE versus endurance) and duration are varied (2.5 vs. 10.5 h for HIE and endurance exercise, respectively), similar physiological and cellular adaptations can occur (Gibala et al. 2006). Furthermore, our group recently confirmed these findings by demonstrating comparable changes in systemic markers of lipolysis and fat oxidation during the recovery period following workload matched low volume HIE and continuous (CON) exercise (Gerber et al. 2014). However, despite the two protocols being isoenergetic, plasma hypoxanthine accumulation and urinary purine base excretion was higher following the HIE, compared to the CON exercise (Gerber et al. 2014). As these degradation products of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are considered an indirect indication of ATP loss from the muscle, we suggested that the energy required for subsequent restorative processes (via intramuscular purine de novo replacement) may in part contribute to the negative energy balance that leads to fat loss often observed following long term HIE training programs (Gerber et al. 2014).

In addition, although HIE favors carbohydrate utilization relative to fat as a fuel source during exercise, evidence suggests that the muscle adaptations that occur during recovery following HIE may induce greater fat oxidation post exercise when compared to low to moderate bouts of exercise (Trapp et al. 2008; Tremblay et al. 1990; van Loon et al. 2001; Yoshioka et al. 2001). Higher relative fat oxidation post exercise could also be a contributing factor in the fat loss observed following HIE training. These findings and others (Gibala et al. 2012; Malatesta et al. 2009) indicate that training programs of high intensity and low volume may be very effective at stimulating metabolic disturbances that induce enhanced weight loss resulting from in the form of reduced adipose tissue, but also promote health and fitness benefits normally seen over the long term.

To explore the aforementioned concepts further, given most research in this area only compares HIE to submaximal exercise, our laboratory examined altered exercise intensity and subsequent passive rest periods at a supramaximal level to establish whether skeletal muscle metabolism could be further manipulated at higher exercise intensities. Using three isoenergetic supramaximal low volume HIE protocols (150, 200 and 300 % of VO2peak) and selecting specific metabolites that relate to glycolysis and purine metabolism, we showed no differences in plasma inosine, xanthine and uric acid following the three workload matched protocols, but significant differences in plasma lactate area under the curve calculations and urinary hypoxanthine excretion (data not shown). These findings indicate that a stimulus threshold may exist for specific metabolites when supramaximal intensity exercise is performed and going above this threshold may not induce any greater physiological change or further stimulate already maximal adaptations rates (i.e., a “biological ceiling”) proposed by Booth & Watson (1985). However, since research to date has been highly selective with respect to the metabolites monitored, changes in other important metabolites and pathways are likely to be missed.

Metabolomics, defined as “the quantitative measurement of the dynamic multiparametric metabolic response of living systems to pathophysiological stimuli or genetic modification” involves characterizing and quantifying a large number of metabolites and other small molecules that are present in a biological sample at one time (Nicholson et al. 1999). As such, metabolomics can provide a metabolite “signature” or “fingerprint” of the relative concentrations of multiple metabolites which can better predict phenotypic changes from genotypes (Barabasi and Oltvai 2004). In the area of HIE research, metabolomics technology may help monitor metabolite changes concurrent with exercise, which may elucidate any relationships or trends for comparison. Moreover, by utilizing an untargeted metabolomics approach, both the characterization of core metabolome changes commonly covered in the targeted approach can be achieved, with the addition of detecting previously unknown or poorly characterized metabolites (Boughton et al. 2011).

The primary purpose of this study was to compare two workload matched supramaximal low volume HIE models using an untargeted metabolomics approach. We hypothesized that despite the workload matched nature of the protocols, the higher supramaximal exercise intensity would induce greater metabolic perturbations in glucose metabolism during exercise and fatty acid and lipid metabolism during the recovery period, compared to the lower supramaximal exercise intensity.

2 Methods
2.1 Participants
Seven healthy, recreationally active males (22.9 ± 5.0 year; 81.6 ± 4.9 kg; 178.7 ± 4.5 cm; 50.0 ± 6.1 ml kg min−1 VO2peak) volunteered to take part in this study. The study was approved by the Victoria University Human Research Ethics Committee (HRETH 10/12) and all procedures were performed in accordance with the ethical standards set out in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study. Each participant completed a medical questionnaire and presented for preliminary testing.

2.2 Preliminary testing
VO2peak was determined approximately 1 week prior to the first experimental trial. A standard graded exercise protocol on a Excalibur Lode Cycle ergometer (Netherlands) of 3 × 3 min submaximal workloads at 50, 100 and 150 W followed by successive 1 min workload increments of 25 W until volitional exhaustion. Participants were encouraged to maintain a pedal frequency between 80 and 100 RPM and the test was terminated when this could not be maintained for a period of 5 s. Expired air was directed by a Hans Rudolph valve via a ventilometer into a mixing chamber and analyzed for oxygen and carbon dioxide content using Turbofit software (Vacumed, USA). Prior to each VO2peak test the gas analyzer was calibrated using commercially prepared gas mixtures (BOC Gases, Australia). Prior to commencing exercise testing, participants underwent a familiarization session to become accustomed to the exercise protocols to be performed.

2.3 Experimental trial protocols
Participants were asked to complete two supramaximal low volume HIE protocols (Fig. 1) in a randomized order and separated by at least 1 week: (1) HIE150 %: 30 × 20 s cycling at 150 % VO2peak, 40 s passive rest (348 ± 27 W); 2) HIE300 %: 30 × 10 s cycling at 300 % VO2peak, 50 s passive rest (697 ± 54 W). Exercise trials were 30 min in duration and workload matched (i.e., exercise intensity and the duration of cycling and rest intervals were manipulated to ensure participants cycled at 150 and 300 % of their VO2peak). Similar to the VO2peak test, these protocols were performed on an Excalibur Lode Cycle ergometer (Netherlands) and participants were encouraged to maintain a pedal frequency between 80 and 100 RPM during cycling intervals. HIE was preceded by a rest period and followed by 60 min passive recovery in a supine position. Participants were asked to refrain from consuming caffeine and alcohol, and from undertaking strenuous exercise 24 h prior to all experimental trials. Participants recorded their dietary intake for 24 h before the first experimental trial and were asked to replicate meals the day prior to the subsequent trial. Experimental trials were conducted in the morning, approximately 10–12 h after the last meal in order to produce a fasted state. Borg Scale ratings of perceived exertion (RPE 6–20 scale) were recorded throughout the exercise bouts to determine which low volume HIE protocol was perceived to be the most physically demanding by the participants.

2.4 Blood sampling and preparation
Each participant had an intravenous cannula inserted into a vein in the antecubital space to obtain blood samples throughout each experimental trial protocol, and this was kept patent with isotonic saline (0.9 % NaCl, Pfizer). Blood was sampled at rest, 10 min into exercise (EX10), immediately after exercise (EX30) and at the end of the 60 min recovery period (RC60). Samples were immediately placed into lithium heparin (BD Vacutainer) tubes and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 2 min. Plasma was decanted and stored at −80 °C for later metabolomic and albumin analysis. Plasma albumin was measured using a commercially available bromocresol green albumin assay kit (Sigma Aldrich, Australia) and used as an indirect marker and estimation of plasma volume changes during exercise (Maughan et al. 1985).

2.5 Metabolomics analysis: GC-MS
2.5.1 Metabolite extraction and preparation
50 µL of each lithium heparin treated plasma sample was diluted with 150 µl of MeOH [spiked with 4 % 13C6-Sorbitol as an extraction internal standard (ISTD)]. The samples were briefly vortexed and placed on ice for 10 min prior to being centrifuged at 13,200 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C to precipitate any protein present. 100 µl supernatant was separated and transferred into 6 mm diameter conical bottom glass vial inserts (Phenomenex, Australia) that had been placed inside eppendorf vials. An additional 10 µl supernatant from each extracted sample was combined into a separate eppendorf vial, which was vortexed and used to create 5 × 100 µl pooled biological quality control (PBQC) glass vial inserts. Eppendorf vials containing inserts were then dried in vacuo (RVC 2-33, John Morris, Australia) at a temperature of −55 °C and pressure of 3 mbar for 2 h. Glass vial inserts were then placed into 2 ml wide-top glass vials and covered with metallic crimp caps (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA). Additional glass vials containing methyloxime (MeOX) (10 µl per sample) and trimethylsilane (TMS) (20 µl per sample) were prepared for derivatisation.

2.5.2 Instrumentation
The GC-MS system used comprised of a 7000B Agilent gas chromatograph triple-quadrupole and a 5975C Agilent triple-axis mass selective detector (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA). A Gerstal Technologies MPS2XL GC-MS autosampler was set to select samples for analysis in a randomized order. MeOX and TMS derivatized samples were injected onto the GC column using a hot needle technique. The injection was operated in both a splitless (1 µl sample) and split (0.20 µl sample) modes to avoid overloaded chromatogram peaks. An inlet temperature of 230 °C and helium was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 1 ml min−1 along a 30 m VF-5MS column with 0.25 nm film thickness, and a 10 m Integra guard column, for chromatographic separation (Varian Inc., Victoria, Aus). The MS transfer line to the quadrupole was fixed at 280 °C, the EI ion source fixed at 250 °C, and the MS quadrupole fixed at 150 °C. The oven set up for sample analysis was: injection temperature of 70 °C for a 1 min hold, followed by 1 °C min−1 increase to 76 °C (with no hold), and a 7 °C min−1 increase to a final temperature of 325 °C for a 5 min hold. The GC-MS system was equilibrated for 1 min at 70 °C prior to the injection of the next sample. Ions were generated by a 70 eV electron beam at an ionization current of 2.0 mA and spectra were recorded at 2.91 scans per second with a mass-to-charge ratio of 50:550 atomic mass units (amu) scanning range.

2.5.3 Data handling
An automated mass spectral deconvolution and identification system (AMDIS) was used to analyze the chromatogram. A random PBQC was used for data filtering (to remove background noise), deconvolution (to align peaks and correct for retention time drifts between runs) and peak detection (via characteristics of each ion including m/z ratio, retention time and ion intensity). Using the in-house Metabolomics Australia (University of Melbourne, Australia) mass spectra library the mass spectra were then additionally verified by analysis of reference standard compounds. MassHunter was then used to analyze the relative response ratio for each detected peak (the area of each unique ion) from the randomly selected PBQC, prior to being applied to the remainder of the batch (see supplementary data for metabolite identification details). Each individual sample was then cross-checked to ensure that the correct peaks had been selected in this process, and that peaks matched across all samples. Metabolites were identified according to metabolomics standards initiative (MSI) level 1. Overloaded peaks (lactate, glucose, mannose, sucrose, fructose, urea and cholesterol) were analyzed separately from the split mode. Relative response ratio data for each compound detected in each sample was normalized to the ISTD (13C6-Sorbitol). MetaboAnalyst 2.0 (Xia et al. 2012) was used to generate multivariate analysis pattern analysis models, with normalization via a generalized log transformation applied to the data matrix to improve symmetry prior to multivariate analysis. Experimental data were additionally mapped on an author created metabolite network via VANTED V2.1.0. The human metabolome database (HMDB) (Wishart et al. 2013) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (Kanehisa & Goto 2000) database were used to assist in the development of this visual metabolite network.

2.5.4 Data analysis and statistical methods
An in house Metabolomics Australia Macro software (University of Melbourne, Australia) was used as an initial statistical measurement to determine x-fold change (x-FC), with Graphpad Prism 6.02 used to present x-FC results (USA). PLS-DA was performed on the whole set of metabolites (variables) at each time point to select those with a real discriminating power (SIMCA (version 14; Umetrics, Sweden). Metabolites corresponding to variable importance for projection (VIP) value ≥1.0 were classified as VIP metabolites and selected for further analysis. Two measurements of model quality were reported for Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA): R2Y and Q 2 representing, respectively, the goodness of fit (i.e., data variation) and the goodness of prediction, as estimated by cross-validation. Q 2 ≥ 1.0 can be considered as a good predictor and <0.5 as insignificant (Grootveld et al. 2012; Wold et al. 1984). Cross-validation was used in each PLS-DA model to determine the number of components for subsequent univariate analysis and to avoid overfitting of the data. Normality of the distribution for VIP metabolites was tested using the Shapiro–Wilk test. When necessary, raw data were log-transformed to obtain normality. Normally distributed data were analysed using repeated-measures analysis of variance. If this analysis revealed any significant time and time x trial interaction effects (p > 0.05), paired t tests were used to compare changes over time within trials, and differences between trials. Data that were not normally distributed after log transformation were analysed using the nonparametric Friedman’s test. If the result of this test was significant (p > 0.05), Wilcoxon’s signed-rank tests were used to compare changes within trials, and differences between trials. Data are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) unless otherwise stated. The level of probability was set at p < 0.05. Two-way ANOVA’s with repeated measures (Sidak Bonferroni method) was used to calculated individual significance for each VIP metabolite with time variable as the within group factor and exercise protocol variable as the between group factor. Where an interaction was detected, multiple comparisons with Tukey’s post hoc tests were completed to identify the differences.

The paired data structure in our crossover multivariate data is suitable for multilevel PLS-DA (ML-PLS-DA) analysis. The data were analysed in parallel with the PLS-DA described above using a Matlab (MathWorks, USA, version 2015) routine provided by the Biosystems Data Analysis Group; Universiteit van Amsterdam (Westerhuis et al. 2010). Paired time points were assessed for consecutive samples and also for EX30 and RC60, relative to REST. Default parameters were used for the n-fold component variables (1CV, 5; 2CV, 4; maximum number of PLS factors, 6; 2CV and CMV repeats (5 and 1000, respectively)).

3 Results
Treatment of the chromatogram via AMDIS resulted in the detection of 55 metabolites, 12 of which had unknown identities (see supplementary Table S1 for parameters of known metabolites). Additional unknown compounds were detected, however only those peaks which demonstrated statistically significant changes between or within exercise protocols at time points other than baseline were selected for further analysis (see supplementary Table S2 for analysis of unknown metabolites). Paired crossover multivariate data models, 2D PLS-DA with Pareto Data Scaling was used to determine the within subject variation (Fig. 2). PLS-DA ellipses represent 95 % confidence intervals. At rest, PLS-DA modelling method demonstrated a similar (non-significant) metabolic profile between groups prior to commencement of each trial (p = 0.009), with very good validation metrics, including R2Y = 0.98 and Q 2 = 0.93. At 10 min post exercise, notable separation between trials was observed (p = 0.001), with good validation metrics, including R2Y = 0.77 and Q 2 = 0.74. At 30 and 60 min post exercise, a significantly clear separation between the two trials was identified (p = 0.005, 30 min, p = 0.03, 60 min), with moderate to high validation metrics, including R2Y = 0.88 and Q 2 = 0.70 and R2Y = 0.90 and Q 2 = 0.76 for 30 and 60 min post exercise respectively.

Correlation coefficient scores based on the weighted sum of the PLS regression identified the top metabolites with the overall greatest influence on the components at each time point (supplementary Fig. S1). PLS-DA cross validation determined 25 metabolites in total with VIP scores value ≥1 for subsequent ANOVA analysis to determine which metabolites responded to exercise (Effect of Exercise Intensity within group) and the different intensities (Effect of Exercise Intensity between groups) (supplementary Table S3 lists metabolites with VIP scores of ≥1 for each time point).

3.1 Effect of the exercise trial
Both exercise protocols (HIE150 % and HIE300 %) elicited similar responses in heart rate with no differences observed during and following the exercise session (data not shown). Similarly, exercise-induced changes in plasma albumin concentrations were also comparable between trials at all observed time points (data not shown). A significant difference in RPE was shown at 15 and 30 min following exercise commencement, with participants perceiving the HIE300 % condition “harder” when compared to the HIE150 % bout when considered on a numerical scale analysis and presented as median (interquartile range) [15 min: HIE150 %, 12 (10–13) (representing “Fairly light”), HIE300 %, 15 (14–16) (representing “Hard”) (p = 0.003); 30 min: HIE150 %, 13 (11–14) (representing “Somewhat Hard”), HIE300 %, 16 (13–18) (representing “Hard”) (p = 0.020)].

3.2 Effect of the exercise intensity (between group analysis)
Fold changes (x-FC) were calculated for each time point by comparing the relative response ratios for each detected metabolite in the HIE300 % trial to the corresponding HIE150 % trial value (Fig. 3). At rest, fructose and sorbose were significantly lower, whilst sugar alcohol xylitol and TCA intermediate citrate were significantly higher in the HIE300 % trial compared to the HIE150 % trial (p < 0.04). During exercise, lysine and lactate were significantly higher (p < 0.02), whereas citrate was significantly lower in the HIE300 % trial compared to the HIE150 % trial (p < 0.02). Immediately following exercise, sorbose, lactate and cholesterol were significantly higher (p < 0.05), whereas amino acid alanine, saturated fatty acids hexadecanoic acid methyl ester, hexadecanoate, and octadecanoic acid, sugar alcohol xylitol and TCA cycle intermediate citrate were significantly lower in the HIE300 % trial compared to the HIE150 % trial (p < 0.05). During recovery, amino acid asparagine, saturated fatty acids dodecanoate, hexadecanoic acid methyl ester, hexadecanoate, and octadecanoic acid, saccharide gluconic acid, sugar alcohols xylitol, sugar xylose, TCA cycle intermediates citrate, glutamate, succinate, organophosphate glycerol-3-phosphate were significantly lower in the HIE300 % trial compared to the HIE150 % trial (p < 0.05), conversely uric acid, cholesterol and lactate were significantly higher in the HIE300 % trial compared to the HIE150 % at RC60 (p < 0.05).

3.3 Effect of the exercise intensity (within group analysis)
Univariate analysis was used to determine to impact of supramaximal exercise on individual metabolites regardless of exercise intensity (Fig. 4). Plasma lactate was increased significantly during and at the end of exercise in both trials (p < 0.001), but remained significantly elevated during the recovery period in the HIE300 % trial only (p = 0.004). Malate was significantly increased during and at the end of exercise in both trials (p < 0.001) and remained significantly elevated during the recovery period following the HIE150 % trial only (p < 0.02). Glutamate was significantly decreased during the recovery period following the HIE300 % trial only (p < 0.05). Citrate was significantly increased during exercise, immediately post exercise and 60 min post exercise in the HIE150 % trial (p < 0.005), conversely, during the HIE300 % trial, citrate was significantly decreased during exercise (p = 0.042), with no significant changes occurring post exercise.

The glucogenic amino acid asparagine, was significantly lower at the end of exercise and remained significantly lower at 60 min post exercise following the HIE300 % trial when compared to rest (p < 0.05). Alanine was significantly higher at 60 min post exercise compared to rest (p = 0.033) following the HIE300 % trial whereas ketogenic amino acid lysine was significantly lower at 60 min post exercise following the HIE300 % trial (p < 0.05). During the HIE150 % trial, alanine was significantly increased immediately post exercise (p = 0.011). Saturated fatty acids octadecanoic acid and hexadecanoate, organic acid erythronate, and sugars xylitol and xylose were significantly lower post exercise and during the recovery period when compared to rest in the HIE300 % trial (p < 0.05), whereas saturated fatty acid dodecanoate was significantly lower at 60 min post exercise (p = 0.034). During the HIE150 % trial, only xylose significantly changed, with an increase at 60 min post exercise (p = 0.013). Sugars sorbose and fructose were significantly elevated at the end of exercise during the HIE300 % trial (p < 0.05). Conversely, sorbose was significantly lower at the end of the recovery period following the HIE150 % trial (p = 0.016). Glucose remained constant during exercise and post exercise in both exercise trials (p > 0.05). Total cholesterol significantly increased during exercise and remained significantly elevated post exercise following the HIE300 % trial (p = 0.002). Conversely, total cholesterol was significantly decreased during the recovery period following the HIE150 % trial (p < 0.001), with no significant changes observed during and at the end of exercise.

The frequency histogram produced by the ML-PLS-DA analysis of paired time-points for the two exercise levels did not show a clear difference in the number of misclassifications (NMC), relative to PLS-DA for any of the comparisons examined (supplementary Fig. S2). The red dot in each histogram shows the classification error (estimated number of misclassifications) for the model, relative to the permutations (blue). The prediction error (NMC = 0) is less than the permutations and similar for both ML-PLS-DA and PLS-DA, indicating that the statistical significance of the two methods is similar. The lower panel in the figure shows the rank product (RP1/20) with the lowest RPs most strongly associated with the treatment effect. In rank order, the five metabolites contributing most at each interval were, respectively, 0–10: malate, succinate, alanine, lactate, glutamine; 10–30: malate, gluconic acid, arginine, fumarate, lactate; 30–60: malate, lactate, aspartate, rhamnose, glycerol; 0–30: malate, alanine, succinate, fumerate, lactate; 0–60: alanine, isoleucine, citrate, leucine, rhamnose. The lack of any clear difference between the ML-PLS-DA and standard PLS-DA analysis may be due to the small sample size in our study and the relatively noisy data when comparing results from different time points.

4 Discussion
The current study used an untargeted metabolomics approach to monitor parallel changes of multiple metabolic perturbations induced by two workload matched supramaximal low volume HIE protocols, with different work to rest ratios. The variation in intensity of these protocols was designed to elicit substantial metabolic disturbances whilst minimizing the time between efforts for energy replenishment in order to stimulate a physiological response. The major finding of the study is that despite the two protocols being matched for total work, the HIE300 % trial produced greater metabolic perturbations compared to the HIE150 % trial. Furthermore, changes were more pronounced during the recovery period rather than during exercise and were specific to metabolites of the glycolytic pathway and fatty acid and lipid metabolism; suggesting higher workload draws on cellular reserves more than liver and circulating energy levels. Data from the current study highlight the benefit of using metabolomics technology to examine exercise intensity-dependent changes in metabolic pathways that may contribute to the proposed health and fitness benefits often observed with HIE training.

The lack of any clear difference between the ML-PLS-DA and standard PLS-DA analysis may be due to the small sample size in our study and the relatively noisy data when comparing results from different time points. Malate was the predominant metabolite identified as significant in the ML-PLS-DA at all time intervals and lactate was significant between all time points. Other metabolites participating in the TCA were also shown to significantly influence the model (succinate, citrate, and fumarate). Metabolites involved in other pathways that were identified in the PLS-DA were also identified by the ML-PLS-DA include amino acids involved in the restoration of hepatic glucose metabolism (particularly alanine and glutamine) and branched amino acids typically degraded during exercise (isoleucine and leucine).

HIE leads to a reduction in skeletal muscle glycogen levels and in recovery, the metabolic priority of the muscle is to restore glycogen stores (Malatesta et al. 2009). Numerous studies have also demonstrated an increase in whole-body fat oxidation after glycogen-depleting exercise, indicating both a shift towards greater fat oxidation and restoration of the plasma bicarbonate pool (Bielinski et al. 1985; Gerber et al. 2014; Kiens and Richter 1998). Despite these findings, little attention has been paid to the role of lipid utilization during the recovery process (Bielinski et al. 1985; Kiens and Richter 1998). Following exercise, sources of fat are obtained from circulation [fatty acids, chylomicrons, very low density lipoproteins (VLDL)], or within the muscle fiber itself in the form of lipid droplets adjacent to the mitochondria (Kimber et al. 2003). Though intramuscular triglycerides (IMTG) may contribute to the lipid source for fat oxidation, it is likely that plasma fatty acids are the predominant contributor to increased fatty acid oxidation post exercise (Kimber et al. 2003). Indeed, Kimber et al. (2003) demonstrated a rapid decline in non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs), early in the recovery period following approximately 85 min of varied intensity exercise. In the current study, plasma concentrations of fatty acids dodecanoate (C12—also known as lauric acid), hexadecanote (C16—also known as palmitic acid), hexadecanoic acid methyl ester (C17—also known as palmitic acid, methyl ester), and octadecanoic (C18—also known as Stearic acid), significantly decreased during the 60 min recovery period following the HIE300 % trial compared to the HIE150 % trial. Few studies have used a metabolomics approach to examine changes in NEFAs. Peake et al. (2014) used a targeted metabolomics approach to investigate changes in metabolites following two isoenergetic bouts of interval HIE (80 % VO2max) and moderate intensity CON exercise (65 % VO2max) in well trained cyclists and triathlete males. Contrary to our findings, interval HIE at 80 % VO2max increased specific NEFAs myristic acid (C14:0), decanoic acid (C10:0), dodecanoic acid (C12:0), heptadecenoic acid (C17:1) and palmitoleic acid (C16:1) after exercise, with some of these fatty acids remaining elevated for 2 h post exercise (Peake et al. 2014). Additionally, moderate intensity CON exercise at 65 % VO2max also increased these specific NEFAs. It is clear that intensity (60 and 80 % VO2max vs. 150 and 300 % VO2peak) of the protocols and training status (trained versus recreationally active) of the participants used in the Peake et al., study, compared to the current study, are different and as such may explain the contrasting changes in specific plasma fatty acids following exercise and during the recovery period. Furthermore, participants in the Peake et al., study consumed breakfast prior to exercising which may have impacted on the metabolic response to exercise. Notwithstanding, the significant reductions in plasma free fatty acids observed in the current study could demonstrate their usage as a primary source of fuel during the recovery period as confirmed by other studies (Friedlander et al. 1998; Kimber et al. 2003). It is understood that changes in plasma free fatty acids during exercise are dynamic and recovery following exercise represents a balance between fatty acid release from adipose tissue and fatty acid uptake into skeletal muscle and liver (Mulla et al. 2000). Given no food was ingested post exercise in the current study; an insulin-mediated inhibition of lipolysis was unlikely to occur, although a catecholamine-induced lipolytic effect post exercise cannot be ruled out. It is not readily apparent however, as to why only the higher supramaximal HIE trial showed a decrease in plasma free fatty acids. It could be that both trials increased fatty acid mobilization during recovery and that the higher intensity exercise showed preferential utilization of these saturated fatty acids. However, RER, an indicator of fatty acid oxidation was not measured post exercise and thus is a limitation in the current study.

Exercise training promotes beneficial effects on health by reducing total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) levels and triglycerides (TG) (Bellou et al. 2013; Mulla et al. 2000; Tsekouras et al. 2008). Contrary to the majority of studies that have used moderate to high intensity protocols of CON nature (60–90 % VO2max) to study the impact on total cholesterol and lipid metabolism; we utilized a supramaximal intermittent intensity protocol of 150 % VO2peak and 300 % VO2peak. Our results demonstrated contrasting outcomes, with the 300 % VO2peak protocol increasing total cholesterol during exercise and throughout the recovery period, whereas the 150 % VO2peak protocol decreased total cholesterol during the recovery period only. Although there is a lack of comparable studies, one study did examine the impact of a bout of supramaximal intensity exercise performed at 115 % VO2max (Lira et al. 2010). The results from this study showed no significant impact on serum total cholesterol or other markers of lipid metabolism (Lira et al. 2010). Given the conflicting exercise-induced changes in plasma lipid profiles (including total cholesterol), several studies have suggested that an “energy expenditure threshold” may exist and that higher levels of energy expenditure may be required to promote favorable changes in lipid metabolism (i.e., reduction in TG and the increase in HDL-C concentrations) following HIE (Aellen et al. 1993; Lira et al. 2009; Tsekouras et al. 2008). Indeed, the exercise session performed in the Lira et al. (2010) study generated 50 % less energy expenditure than their previous study which demonstrated a beneficial impact on lipid metabolism (Lira et al. 2009). Despite this, both protocols used in the current study were workload matched and thus similar energy expenditures would be assumed. On the other hand, exercise intensity was not the same between trials and this may have impacted hepatic regulation differently due to the higher energetic stress and higher levels of circulating catecholamine’s (Lira et al. 2012). A limitation to the present study was the measurement of only one form of lipid in the plasma and as a result changes in HDL-C and TC/HDL-C are unknown. Further research is needed to confirm our observed changes following the 150 and 300 % VO2peak exercise bouts, but also the impact of higher intensities on hepatic metabolism and serum lipid profiles.

The TCA cycle is the major final common pathway for oxidation of carbohydrates, lipids and some amino acids, resulting in the production of large amounts of ATP via oxidative phosphorylation. The TCA cycle flux is dependent upon the supply of acetyl units and activation of the three non-equilibrium reactions within the TCA cycle. Evidence suggests that an increase in the total concentration of the TCA cycle intermediates (TCAI) is imperative to increase and maintain TCA cycle flux during exercise (Peake et al. 2014). Measurement of plasma TCAI’s suggests that these metabolites can be released (or at least efflux) from the muscle as well as other metabolically active organs, such as the liver. Our analysis revealed significant increases in plasma TCAIs (malate, succinate, fumarate) in response to both supramaximal exercise intensities. Plasma citrate was also significantly increased in the HIE150 % trial, but was significantly decreased during the HIE300 % trial. These results are in accordance with a previous metabolomics-based study investigating plasma changes with exercise in which accumulated levels of malate, fumarate and succinate were reported 60 min following exercise in healthy individuals (Lewis et al. 2010). This has also been confirmed in two recent studies using HIE protocols (Brugnara et al. 2012; Peake et al. 2014). There is some evidence to suggest that changes in TCAIs are intensity dependent with previous investigations demonstrating greater changes during HIE compared to low moderate exercise of similar duration and energy expenditure (Peake et al. 2014). Our study showed no difference between the two supramaximal bouts of exercise, which may indicate a potential intensity threshold in which no further changes can occur above a certain exercise intensity. Interestingly, despite no differences between groups during exercise (excluding citrate), there were differences during the recovery period with both malate and fumarate remaining significantly elevated following the HIE150 % trial only compared to rest. These results, and those observed for fatty acid and lipid metabolism, suggest intensity of exercise, especially at supramaximal levels, and may have a greater impact on specific metabolites during the recovery period than during the exercise bout itself.

The minimal effect of both exercise trials on the appearance of plasma amino acids during exercise in the present study may suggest that the liberated amino acids at the beginning of exercise were used for synthesis of TCAIs and glutamine synthesis and thus, were not released from the muscle. During the recovery period restoration of hepatic glucose metabolism is a priority and amino acids (particularly alanine), pyruvate and lactate assist in that process (Brugnara et al. 2012; Mourtzakis et al. 2006). Further, glutamine and alanine may stimulate a significant rise in arterial blood glucose concentration during recovery from exercise (Brugnara et al. 2012; Mourtzakis et al. 2006; Peake et al. 2014). Indeed both lactate and alanine were increased post exercise following the both trials and may have contributed to the maintained glucose levels observed.

5 Concluding remarks
The utilization of an untargeted metabolomics approach provides researchers with the ability to examine a wider range of metabolic interactions and potential pathways. However, this is not without its limitations and is restricted by the current mass spectra library database. Thus our ability to identify all detected metabolites and full interpretation of all metabolic changes in the present study was determined by the limitations of this database at the time. With continual updating of the library database with new metabolites, the scope of this technology will be expanded and will be more informative in the future. Additional limitations in the current study may have been the relative small cohort studied and the differences in some metabolites observed at rest. Although, these differences are most likely not due to a training/stress effect given the cross-over design of the study. Notwithstanding, the need for further studies using a larger cohort is required to confirm and extend the current findings. In summary, this study demonstrated greater metabolic perturbations in fatty acid, lipid metabolism and glycolysis following a HIE300 % protocol compared to a HIE150 % protocol. These changes were more pronounced during the recovery period than during the exercise bout and highlight that future work should investigate the impact of supramaximal low volume intermittent HIE on different plasma fatty acids during exercise and recovery period. This study provides further support for the beneficial impact of supramaximal exercise on total cholesterol and other lipids, which may have positive health implications. Finally, given the contrasting effects observed during recovery from exercise between protocols, there is potential to explore different recovery techniques (i.e., passive versus active) with a metabolomics approach to examine how such differences impact on metabolite recovery.
