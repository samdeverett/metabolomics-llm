ABSTRACT
The objectives of this work were the classification of dynamic
metabolic biomarker candidates and the modeling and characterization
of kinetic regulatory mechanisms in human metabolism with response to
external perturbations by physical activity. Longitudinal metabolic
concentration data of 47 individuals from 4 different groups were
examined, obtained from a cycle ergometry cohort study. In total, 110
metabolites (within the classes of acylcarnitines, amino acids, and
sugars) were measured through a targeted metabolomics approach,
combining tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) with the concept of stable
isotope dilution (SID) for metabolite quantitation. Biomarker
candidates were selected by combined analysis of maximum fold changes
(MFCs) in concentrations and _P_-values resulting from statistical
hypothesis testing. Characteristic kinetic signatures were identified
through a mathematical modeling approach utilizing polynomial fitting.
Modeled kinetic signatures were analyzed for groups with similar
behavior by applying hierarchical cluster analysis. Kinetic shape
templates were characterized, defining different forms of basic
kinetic response patterns, such as sustained, early, late, and other
forms, that can be used for metabolite classification. Acetylcarnitine
(C2), showing a late response pattern and having the highest values in
MFC and statistical significance, was classified as late marker and
ranked as strong predictor (MFC = 1.97, _P_ < 0.001). In the class of
amino acids, highest values were shown for alanine (MFC = 1.42, _P_ <
0.001), classified as late marker and strong predictor. Glucose yields
a delayed response pattern, similar to a hockey stick function, being
classified as delayed marker and ranked as moderate predictor (MFC =
1.32, _P_ < 0.001). These findings coincide with existing knowledge on
central metabolic pathways affected in exercise physiology, such as
β-oxidation of fatty acids, glycolysis, and glycogenolysis. The
presented modeling approach demonstrates high potential for dynamic
biomarker identification and the investigation of kinetic mechanisms
in disease or pharmacodynamics studies using MS data from longitudinal
cohort studies.
AUTHOR SUMMARY
Human metabolism is controlled through basic kinetic regulatory
mechanisms, where the overall system aims to maintain a state of
homeostasis. In response to external perturbations, such as
environmental influences, nutrition or physical exercise, circulating
metabolites show specific kinetic response patterns, which can be
computationally modeled. In this work, we searched for dynamic
metabolic biomarker candidates and analyzed specific kinetic
mechanisms from longitudinal metabolic concentration data, obtained
through a cycle ergometry stress test. In total, 110 metabolites
measured from blood samples of 47 individuals were analyzed using
tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Dynamic biomarker candidates could
be selected based on the amplitudes of changes in metabolite
concentrations and the significance of statistical hypothesis testing.
We were able to characterize specific kinetic patterns for groups of
similarly behaving metabolites. Kinetic shape templates were
identified, defining basic kinetic response patterns to physical
exercise, such as sustained, early, late and other shape forms. The
presented approach contributes to a better understanding of
(patho)physiological biochemical mechanisms in human health, disease
or during drug therapy, by offering tools for classifying dynamic
biomarker candidates and for modeling and characterizing kinetic
regulatory mechanisms from longitudinal experimental data.
INTRODUCTION
METABOLITE KINETICS—BIOCHEMICAL ASPECTS
Basic principles in reaction kinetics of biomolecules were described
by the work of Guldberg & Waage  1–3  more than 150 years ago and
recently resumed by Voit _et al_., 2015  4  in their perspective
article "150 years of mass action". The underlying concept is the law
of mass action, describing the quantitative aspects of a chemical
reaction under ideal conditions. If a substance C is formed by the
reaction of substance A and substance B, the production of C can be
described by the following equation
ProductC=k A B
(1)
where _A_, _B_, and _C_ are concentrations changing over time, and _k_
is a rate constant describing the speed of the reaction. Probably the
most widely known and used modification of the original model in
biochemistry is the Michaelis-Menten rate law (MMRL) introduced by
Michaelis & Menten in 1913  5 
v=VmaxSKm+S
(2)
where _v_ is the reaction rate, _V_ _max_ the maximum reaction rate,
_S_ the concentration of the substrate, and _K_ _m_ the Michaelis
constant (the substrate concentration at half of the maximum reaction
rate).
The Michaelis-Menten model describes the reaction kinetics of an
enzyme-catalyzed single-substrate reaction, in which the conversion of
a substrate _S_ into a product _P_ takes place via the formation of an
intermediate complex _ES_, where _k_ _1_, _k_ _2_ and _k_ _3_ denote
reaction rates  4 
E+S←k2→k1ES→k3E+P
(3)
Guldberg and Waage also examined the fact that biochemical systems
tend to remain in homeostasis, which is described by the equilibrium
constant  6 
Keq= C c D d A a B b
(4)
_K_ _eq_ is the equilibrium constant in the general reaction _aA +
bB_↔_cC + dD_, where _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_ are the number of molecules
of _A_, _B_, _C_, _D_ participating, and _ A _, _ B _, _ C _, _ D _
are the molar reaction concentrations of the reaction components at
equilibrium  7 .
When analyzing regulatory mechanisms of metabolite kinetics, a key
question addresses the effect of external perturbations disturbing
homeostasis, e.g., caused by environmental influences, nutrition, drug
interventions (pharmacodynamics) or physical activity (studied in this
work through clinical exercise testing). These effects can be measured
and examined by longitudinal cohort studies, which investigate dynamic
changes in metabolite concentrations over time.
In chronic toxicity testing, which occupies a central position in the
analysis of dynamic time-course metabolic data, studies are performed
to explore the influences of toxic substances on human or animal
metabolism. Mechanisms of metabolite kinetics are analyzed, e.g., by
investigating the effect of pesticide exposure on children  8,9 , by
_in-vitro_ examination of drug induced effects in neurotoxicity using
brain cell cultures  10 , or by analysis of toxic effects of polymers
or nanoparticles to the water flea _daphnia magna_  11,12 . In
biotechnological process monitoring, metabolic interactions are
analyzed, e.g., in studying the sensitivity of the biocatalyst
_Clostridium thermocellum_ to ethanol stress  13 , in exploring the
forced ageing process of Port wine  14  or by the examination and
optimization of cell culture media, as e.g., of Chinese hamster ovary
(CHO) cells  15–17 . In pharmacodynamics, time-course data are
collected, e.g., to study the effect of continuous exposure of breast
cancer cells to an anti-cancer chemotherapy drug on the metabolic
level  18  or to explore the metabolism of albumin in patients with
systemic inflammatory response syndrome after continuous venovenous
hemofiltration  19 . Research questions on kinetic mechanisms in
physical exercise cover fundamental work, e.g., on studying the
influence of improved metabolic health on patterns in plasma
metabolites  20  or analyzing the effects of aerobic exercise on oral
glucose tolerance  21 .
In this work, in response to an incrementally increased physical load
by cycle ergometry and depending on the underlying metabolic
regulatory mechanisms, metabolites are expected to show specific
kinetic signatures and shape patterns. Expected kinetic response
patterns include: a sustained response (mainly constant concentration
over time, overlaid with biological or instrumental noise), an early
response (main decrease/increase of concentrations shortly after start
of activity), a halving interval response (major change in
concentration at half time of physical activity, e.g., a sigmoid
behavior with a plateau), a late response (strongest decrease/increase
of concentration towards the end of physical activity), and a delayed
response pattern (first mainly sustained metabolite concentration,
then showing a strong reaction after the end of activity during the
recovery phase, respectively).
MODELING OF KINETIC MECHANISMS—COMPUTATIONAL ASPECTS
Regarding computational and mathematical aspects of characterizing
kinetic regulatory mechanisms, different approaches of fundamental
models for the analysis of metabolic processes have been described in
the literature: qualitative models for topological network analysis,
models of flux balance analysis using stoichiometric network
construction and detailed kinetic models representing metabolic
processes using ordinary differential equations (ODEs)  22,23 .
Furthermore, different intermediate approaches do exist, e.g., the
approach of structural kinetic modeling (SKM), approximating local
biochemical mechanisms within a metabolic network by a parametric
linear representation  23 . An overview on different "approximative
kinetic formats used in metabolic network modeling" is given by
Heijnen, 2005  24 . An example for the dynamic simulation of kinetic
mechanisms in metabolism—by simulating the mitochondrial fatty acid
β-oxidation—is presented by Modre _et al_., 2009  25 . Further
examples for theoretical network models as well as dynamic kinetic
simulations can be found in the context of the e-cell project  26 ,
e.g., models for drosophila  27  or the metabolic simulation of red
blood cell storage  28 .
With respect to the analysis of dynamic metabolic data, Smilde _et
al_., 2010  29  distinguish between six groups of methods: methods
based on fundamental models, predefined basic functions, dimension
reduction, multivariate time series models, analysis-of-variance
(ANOVA) type models, and methods based on imposing smoothness.
Analyses of periodic or oscillating data can be performed using
methods such as Fourier analysis, wavelet transformation or principal
component analysis (PCA) with wavelets  29,30 . Hidden Markov models
were presented as a way for using basic functions, allowing
flexibility and adaptation in modeling  29,31 . In particular, in
gene-expression analysis orthogonal polynomials were introduced for
qualitative and quantitative modeling  32,33 .
Alternative methods for the analysis of longitudinal metabolic data,
typically used in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy,
comprise weighted principal component analysis (WPCA)  34  or analysis
of variance (ANOVA) simultaneous component analysis (ASCA)  35 . A
statistical framework for metabolic biomarker discovery in NMR data
was presented by Berk _et al_., 2011  36 , introducing a smoothing
spline mixed effects (SME) model, combined with an associated
functional test statistic. Mishina _et al_., 1993  37  suggested
analyzing the kinetics of biomolecules by fitting differential
equations for the application in pharmacodynamics. A method for
investigating between-metabolite relationships by simultaneous
component analysis with individual differences constraints (SCA-IND)
was presented by Jansen _et al_., 2012  38 . A new method for combined
analysis of proteomics and metabolomics data using integrative pathway
analysis was introduced by Stanberry _et al_., 2013  39 . As an
example for a web-based, freely accessible online service,
Metaboanalyst  40  offers the profiling of longitudinal time-course
data on the basis of a multivariate empirical Bayes approach.
METABOLIC BIOMARKER DISCOVERY
Metabolic biomarkers play an essential role in clinical diagnostics
because of their ability to provide specific insights by being
functional endpoints of human molecular interactions  41 . The general
process for the discovery, verification, and validation of metabolic
biomarker candidates was described by Baumgartner & Graber, 2008  42 .
This process ranges from experimental study design, over clinical
study execution, execution of bioanalytical methods and acquisition of
data, consolidation and integration of data, application of
bioinformatics algorithms and data mining methods for the
identification of biomarker candidates, up to an independent
validation of putative biomarkers by clinical trials. In their review
article, Baumgartner _et al_., 2011  43  give a comprehensive survey
of computational data analysis strategies for the discovery of
biomarker candidates from metabolic data.
A milestone in clinical application of metabolic biomarkers was set by
establishing routine newborn screening programs for inherited
metabolic disorders  44 . The search for novel metabolic biomarkers in
disease covers a wide range of clinical application areas, e.g., the
identification of metabolic markers in prostate cancer by a rule-based
feature selection algorithm  45 , the search of early markers as well
as late markers in planned and spontaneous myocardial infarction
 46,47 , the investigation of metabolic mechanisms in diabetes
 48–50  or the discovery of putative biomarker candidates in chronic
kidney disease  51–53 .
RESEARCH OBJECTIVES
In this article, we present a computational methodology, aimed at the
modeling and characterization of kinetic regulatory mechanisms and the
discovery of dynamic metabolic biomarker candidates in physical
activity. Dynamic time-course metabolic concentration data are
generated from a longitudinal biomarker cohort study by standardized
cycle ergometry experiments. In total, 110 metabolites (including
metabolite classes of acylcarnitines, amino acids and sugars) are
quantitated by a targeted metabolomics approach utilizing mass
spectrometry. After a thorough examination of the measured
concentration data in terms of data quality assurance and reliability,
we selected a set of 30 metabolites relevant in exercise physiology
and considered them for data analysis and modeling in this work.
Metabolite concentrations of 47 individuals, showing different lengths
in their concentration time curves (depending on the individual’s
maximum physical load), are made comparable by means of data
preprocessing. Biomarker candidates are selected depending on maximum
fold changes (MFCs) (the amplitude of changes in concentrations) and
the corresponding _P_-values resulting from statistical hypothesis
testing. Kinetic signatures of metabolites are quantified by a
mathematical modeling approach using polynomial fitting, specifying
the dynamic response patterns of analyzed metabolites during physical
activity. A similarity measure for characterized metabolite kinetic
signatures is obtained through specification of groups of metabolites
by hierarchical cluster analysis. Kinetic shape templates are
identified, specifying common kinetic response patterns and enabling
the classification of dynamic metabolic biomarker candidates according
to their kinetic patterns. Findings are verified and interpreted
through biochemical and metabolic pathway analyses associated with
physical activity.
RESULTS
SELECTION OF DYNAMIC BIOMARKER CANDIDATES
Putative dynamic biomarker candidates are selected from the pool of
analyzed metabolites by combined analysis of MFCs in concentrations
and corresponding _P_-values from statistical hypothesis testing (see
section Maximum fold changes and statistical hypothesis testing).
Results for this data analysis step are visualized as a volcano plot
(Fig 1). The plot demonstrates log2 values of MFCs compared to-log10
values of _P_-values. A significance level of 0.001 was chosen for the
selection of statistical hypothesis testing results (horizontal blue
line). Moderate biomarker candidates are classified with a MFC greater
than 1.20 (vertical blue line). Strong biomarker candidates are
classified with a MFC greater than 1.40 (vertical green line).
Detailed data of all analyzed metabolites, including MFCs, log2(MFCs),
_P_-values, and-log10(_P_-values), are summarized in Table 1.

VOLCANO PLOT.
The volcano plot displays the log2(MFC) between minimum and maximum
concentrations values versus the-log10(_P_-value) calculated from
statistical hypothesis testing. The horizontal blue line indicates the
selected significance level of 0.001. The vertical blue line indicates
the threshold for classification as moderate predictor (MFC > 1.20).
The vertical green line denotes the classification threshold for a
strong predictor (MFC > 1.40). Acetylcarnitine (C2),
propionylcarnitine (C3) and alanine could be selected as strong
biomarker candidates. Valerylcarnitine (C5), arginine, glucose,
butyrylcarnitine (C4), methylmalonylcarnitine (C3-DC-M), and
hydroxyvalerylcarnitine (C5-OH) were identified as moderate biomarker
candidates.

For selection of dynamic biomarker candidates, MFC, log2(MFC),
_P_-value, and-log10(_P_-value) are summarized for each metabolite in
the table. The majority of metabolites show a positive value for
log2(MFC), where only two metabolites, namely carnitine (C0) and
aspartic acid, show a negative value. Identical _P_-values, shown for
some metabolites, result from the applied statistical test (Wilcoxon
Signed Rank test for paired samples), which uses ranks for hypothesis
testing. _P_-values are adjusted according to the false discovery rate
(FDR) correction for multiple comparisons (see section Maximum fold
changes and statistical hypothesis testing).
For the analyzed classes of metabolites, putative biomarker candidates
could be selected and ranked according to MFCs and _P_-values. As
strong biomarker candidates, acetylcarnitine (C2, MFC = 1.97, _P_
<0.001), showing the highest values in the entire set of analyzed
metabolites, propionylcarnitine (C3, MFC = 1.52, _P_ < 0.001) and
alanine (MFC = 1.42, _P_ < 0.001) were identified. Valerylcarnitine
(C5, MFC = 1.38, _P_ < 0.001), arginine (MFC = 1.36, _P_ < 0.001),
glucose (MFC = 1.32, _P_ < 0.001), butyrylcarnitine (C4, MFC = 1.27,
_P_ < 0.001), methylmalonylcarnitine (C3-DC-M, MFC = 1.26, _P_ <
0.001), hydroxyvalerylcarnitine (C5_OH, MFC = 1.26, _P_ < 0.001), and
octadecadienylcarnitine (C18:2, MFC = 1.21, _P_ < 0.001) were ranked
as moderate biomarker candidates.
CHARACTERIZATION OF METABOLITE KINETIC SIGNATURES
Kinetic signatures of analyzed metabolites are expected to show
specific characteristic regulatory patterns, in response to the
incremental increase of physical activity using a cycle ergometry
stress test. Kinetic patterns of the selected 30 metabolites,
characterized by a polynomial fitting approach (see section
Mathematical modeling), are visualized in Fig 2 (acylcarnitines), Fig
3 (amino acids) and Fig 4 (glucose). For standardized visualization of
profiles, the vertical axis is normalized to a range of-20% to 40% of
relative concentration. Note that acetylcarnitine (C2) exceeds this
specified range, showing a maximum increase in relative concentration
of 67%.

KINETIC SIGNATURE OF GLUCOSE.
A delayed response pattern is apparent in glucose, decreasing in
relative concentration (-12%) towards the end of exercise with a steep
increase (up to 13%) after the end of exercise during the recovery
phase.
Different kinetic response patterns were observed. The majority of
metabolites show a sustained response, e.g., threonine, with basically
constant behavior in concentration over time, however overlaid with
biological or instrumental noise. An early response pattern is shown
with valerylcarnitine (C5) with an early decrease in relative
concentration (of approx. -16%) after starting exercise followed by an
increase in relative concentration (to a maximum of 13%). Methionine
could be identified as a metabolite showing a halving interval
response pattern with characteristics similar to a sigmoid function,
showing first a sustained reaction, then an increase in relative
concentration at half time of physical activity (by approx. 13%) and
followed by a plateau (at approx. 9% of relative concentration)
towards the end of physical exercise. Metabolites showing a late
response pattern are e.g., acetylcarnitine (C2) with a slight decrease
(-10%) and then a strong continuous increase in relative concentration
(up to 67%) or alanine with a continuous increase (of approx. 32%) up
to the end of exercise. Glucose shows a delayed response pattern
(similar to a L-curve / hockey stick function, see section
Mathematical modeling) with a minor increase in relative concentration
(approx. 2%) at the beginning of exercise, followed by a continuous
decrease (down to-12%) and a major steep increase in relative
concentration (up to 13%) after the end of exercise during the
recovery phase.
IDENTIFICATION OF METABOLITE GROUPS WITH SIMILAR PATTERNS
Groups of metabolites, showing similar kinetic patterns with response
to physical exercise, were identified by hierarchical cluster analysis
(see section Hierarchical cluster analysis), resulting in a set of
seven distinct clusters. Metabolites and their corresponding cluster
affiliations are summarized in Table 2.

hierarchical cluster analysis. Cutting the hierarchical tree at a
threshold of 35 results in 7 different clusters.
Cluster 1 consists of the two amino acids alanine and arginine.
Cluster 2 and cluster 3 comprise a multitude of metabolites of similar
metabolite kinetics, which show roughly sustained response patterns.

acetylcarnitine (C2), the metabolite showing the strongest response.

SPECIFICATION OF KINETIC SHAPE TEMPLATES
Kinetic shape templates, serving for the classification of similar
metabolite dynamics, could be specified based on the median
concentration curves of each identified cluster (see section
Hierarchical cluster analysis). Identified shapes and their
characteristics are summarized in Fig 5, based on relative
concentration changes in reference to the initial concentration at
rest. Identifiers of kinetic shape templates hereby correspond to
identifiers of resulting metabolite clusters from hierarchical cluster

a late response pattern with a continuous increase in concentration
(alanine and arginine). Shapes 5 (acetylcarnitine (C2)) and 6
(propionylcarnitine (C3) and butyrylcarnitine (C4)) define further
templates for late response patterns, differing in their dynamics in
concentration time courses and maximum concentration changes. Shape 4
demonstrates a template for a delayed response pattern, showing
characteristics similar to a L-curve / hockey-stick function (glucose
and octadecadienylcarnitine (C18:2)).
CLASSIFICATION OF DYNAMIC BIOMARKER CANDIDATES
Dynamic metabolic biomarker candidates are identified and classified
through a two-step analysis procedure: first, by analysis of MFCs in
concentrations and statistical hypothesis testing, and second, by
reviewing and characterizing specified metabolic response patterns and
kinetic shape templates.
The majority of metabolites show a sustained response pattern, staying
within an interval of relative MFC of less than 20%, being ineligible
as putative biomarker candidates. Valerylcarnitine (C5), yielding an
early response pattern, was classified as early marker and moderate
predictor (MFC = 1.38, _P_ < 0.001). Methionine shows a halving
interval response pattern with a sigmoid behavior, but having a
moderate amplitude in concentration (MFC = 1.16, P > 0.001) and was
therefore not selected as a biomarker candidate. A late response
pattern with weak early decrease in concentration was observed with
propionylcarnitine (C3) (strong predictor, MFC = 1.52, _P_ < 0.001),
and butyrylcarnitine (C4) (moderate predictor, MFC = 1.27, _P_ <
0.001), both classified as late biomarker candidates. Alanine (strong
predictor, MFC = 1.42, _P_ < 0.001) and arginine (moderate predictor,
MFC = 1.36, _P_ < 0.001) showed a late response pattern with a
continuous increase in concentration from the beginning of exercise
and were classified as late markers. Highest concentration changes
yielded acetylcarnitine (C2), demonstrating a late response pattern
with a very strong increase towards the end of exercise. C2 was ranked
as strong predictor (MFC = 1.97, _P_ < 0.001) and classified as late
marker. Showing basic delayed response patterns, glucose (MFC = 1.32,
_P_ < 0.001) and octadecadienylcarnitine (C18:2) (MFC = 1.21, _P_ <
0.001) were identified as moderate predictors and classified as
delayed markers.
BIOCHEMICAL INTERPRETATION OF FINDINGS
Thanks to an elaborate body of knowledge in biochemistry, a
peculiarity within the process of data analysis in metabolomics lies
in the dedicated biochemical interpretation of results  54 . This
knowledge is nowadays annotated in public databases, e.g., the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)  55 , and eases the
interpretation of findings in the context of annotated biochemical
pathways.
In exercise physiology, various biochemical reactions in metabolism
play an essential role, predominantly in carbohydrate metabolism
(glycolysis and glycogenolysis), in lipid metabolism (β-oxidation of
free fatty acids) and amino acid metabolism  6 . During a cycle
ergometry stress test, an individual increasingly consumes adenosine
triphosphate (ATP); to compensate this energy consumption and maintain
homeostatic levels of ATP, its production is up-regulated, first
primarily by aerobic processes (respiration), and then anaerobic
fermentation. Under the low-impact conditions chosen in this study
(low initial output of 50 Watt (W) and slow increase of 25 W every
three minutes), the metabolic data demonstrate that the body uses both
glycolysis and β-oxidation of fatty acids as readily available energy
sources, before protein catabolism contributes in a substantial
manner. Of course, the pools of monosaccharides and free fatty acids
have to be replenished by glycogenolysis and lipolysis, respectively.
The findings of this work, i.e., identified biomarker candidates of
exercise metabolism, and characterized metabolite signatures via
specified kinetic shape templates, can be explained through the
metabolic regulatory mechanisms in physical activity. Significant
changes in concentrations of acetylcarnitine (C2) and closely related
short-chain acylcarnitines (C3, C4, and C5) arise from their
involvement in the β-oxidation of free fatty acids with
acetylcarnitine (the single most significant finding) representing the
actual end-point of the β-oxidation of even-numbered fatty acids
which constitute the vast majority of dietary fatty acids and of fatty
acids in the body's adipose tissue. The strong increase in
concentrations of alanine and arginine are representative for an
increased production of glucogenic amino acids through high glycolytic
activity. This connection is most obvious for alanine, which is the
corresponding amino acid of the alpha-keto acid pyruvate and is, thus,
a direct mirror of glycolytic or gluconeogenetic flux  48 . The third
major finding, the overproduction of glucose after the end of the
exercise, is due to the inertia of metabolic regulation. In order to
supply the glycolysis with enough fuel, glucose has to be released
from its storage by glycogenolysis. At the abrupt end of the exercise,
the increased activity of the glycogenolytic machinery cannot be
stopped immediately and, therefore, leads to overcompensated glucose
levels.
DISCUSSION
SUMMARY
In this work we have presented a computational modeling and statistics
approach for the identification of dynamic metabolic signatures
through characterization of kinetic patterns of circulating
metabolites from a physical exercise study. Dynamic time-course
metabolic concentration data were obtained through clinical exercise
testing using a cycle ergometry stress test.
The data of 47 individuals from four different groups were analyzed:
male and female test persons, with either average physical activity or
competitive athletic activity. Lactate concentrations were measured
for all individuals as a gold standard for profiling physical
activity. Metabolite concentrations were quantitated by a targeted
metabolomics approach, combining mass spectrometry analytics with the
concept of stable isotope dilution. From the initial set of 110
metabolites (including classes of acylcarnitines, amino acids and
sugars), we selected a reliable and quality assured set of 30
metabolites for data analysis playing a possible role in exercise
physiology.
Based on the generic process for biomarker discovery in metabolomics,
a computational approach for the analysis of longitudinal metabolic
concentration data was developed. Computational tools were implemented
in R  56  for automating the data analysis workflow. The source file
(R script file) and the underlying dataset (Microsoft Excel file) are
provided as supporting information (S1 File and S2 File). Individual
workload curves, differing in the number of measurements due to
variability in the individual's physical capacity and exertion, were
made comparable by data preprocessing steps including rescaling and
linear interpolation of concentration-time curves.
Putative dynamic biomarker candidates for physical activity were
selected by combined analysis of MFCs in concentrations and _P_-values
of statistical hypothesis testing. Kinetic patterns of analyzed
metabolites were characterized based on a mathematical modeling
approach utilizing polynomial fitting as the method of choice.
Metabolite groups, showing similar kinetic response patterns, were
obtained by applying hierarchical cluster analysis to the set of
characterized metabolite kinetic patterns. Kinetic shape templates
could be specified according to the identified clusters, defining
basic kinetic response patterns used for classification of dynamic
biomarker candidates.
The following kinetic response patterns could be defined: sustained
response (basically constant concentration over time, overlaid with
biological and instrumental noise), early response (significant change
in concentration at the beginning of exercise), late response
(continuous decrease/increase towards the end of activity), and
delayed response (first basic sustained response, with a strong
response and steep decrease/increase in concentration after the end of
the exercise during the recovery phase).
The selected two-step data analysis and modeling strategy including
MFCs in concentrations and statistical hypothesis testing, and the
modeling of kinetic shape templates led to the identification and
classification of dynamic metabolic biomarker candidates for profiling
physical activity. The highest values for MFCs and _P_-values in the
analyzed set of metabolites were shown for acetylcarnitine (C2) (MFC =
1.97, _P_ < 0.001), yielding a late response pattern, and being
classified as strong predictor and late marker. Alanine showed the
highest values in the class of amino acids (MFC = 1.42, _P_ < 0.001)
and yielded a late response pattern, being classified as strong
predictor and late marker. The only considered sugar, glucose, yet
playing a key role in physical activity, yielded a delayed response
pattern classified as moderate predictor (MFC = 1.32, P < 0.001) and
delayed marker.
In terms of biochemical interpretation, findings were verified and
interpreted according to their function in metabolic pathways,
associated primarily with physical exercise (β-oxidation of fatty
acids, glycolysis, and glycogenolysis). Interestingly, biomarker
candidates, identified with the highest predictive value, yielded late
response patterns. This might be seen in the context that lactate
(also a key indicator for profiling physical activity) first shows an
almost sustained response pattern before yielding an exponential
increase in concentration up to a maximum physical load. The primary
occurrence of late response patterns can be interpreted as a
consequence of evolutionary developed regulatory mechanisms in
metabolism to keep the individual's metabolic system in homeostasis
after external perturbations such as spontaneous physical activity.
Using our computational approach we were able to select and classify
dynamic metabolic biomarker candidates and to characterize
physiologically plausible metabolite kinetic patterns in physical
activity, combining the strengths of statistical testing (hypothesis
testing), mathematical modeling (curve fitting) and empiric data
analysis (hierarchical cluster analysis).
METHODOLOGY
Experimental limitations and confounders in the analyzed data may
result from uncertainties about the nutrition of test persons before
exercising (recorded in questionnaires but not objectively
verifiable), varying individual motivations and consequently different
levels of exertion, potential issues during sample taking (e.g.,
incomplete removal of sweat at the point of puncture), or from general
limitations of the analytical approach based on dried blood spots
 57 . It should be noted, that at least two test persons obviously
consumed nutritional supplements in the form of branch-chained amino
acids, influencing the measurement values of xleucine (sum of leucine
and isoleucine).
With reference to the selected cohort, it should be noted that the
study participants formed a heterogeneous group, i.e., they differed
in their level of physical activity and status of training. Therefore,
the baseline concentrations and the kinetic patterns may, to a certain
extent, depend on the volunteers' differences in physical fitness, or
other confounding factors such as anthropometric measures or dietary
habits. Although this paper is primarily focused on the methodology
for deriving kinetic patterns and not so much on the discovery of
exercise-related biochemical mechanisms, the results should be seen
with these limitations in mind.
In terms of data preprocessing, the presented data analysis strategy
reveals strong indifference towards the handling of outliers because
median concentration values are selected from rescaled and
interpolated concentration curves. Cut-off values for the selection of
metabolic biomarker candidates (utilizing MFCs and _P_-values) were
chosen empirically by reviewing obtained results and assuming that
responses, showing changes in concentration within a range of-10% to
+10%, are accepted as biochemically and analytically-caused data
variability. For kinetic modeling, an empirical approach (instead of
applying pre-defined mathematical basic functions) based on polynomial
fitting was chosen, allowing for a more physiological characterization
of metabolite kinetics. Looking at the complete set of characterized
metabolite kinetic signatures, the user can choose an appropriate
polynomial degree after visual inspection or by developing a proper
statistical quality measure e.g., based on an estimation of the
residuals. In a few cases, minor artifacts of approx. 3% in
concentration values of the fitted polynomials do occur, obviously
resulting from a slight overfitting of curves due to the chosen
polynomial degree.
Identification of groups of similarly behaving metabolites by
hierarchical cluster analysis is somewhat affected by the number of
interpolated points in the concentration curves and by the degree
chosen for fitted polynomials. A higher number of interpolation points
as well as different degrees of polynomials were tested, showing high
stability in cluster analysis, however, at a lower node height of the
dendrogram the arrangement of single metabolites changes slightly
between the clusters. Note that the selection of clusters basically
depends on the chosen height (cut-off) of the hierarchical tree.
Depending on the selected cut-off value, two metabolites, i.e.,
methylmalonylcarnitine (C3-DC-M) and hydroxyvalerylcarnitine (C5-OH)
might also be classified as additional biomarker candidates,
interesting for further investigation. Specification of kinetic shape
templates finally builds upon the number of specified clusters,
depending computationally on the selected cut-off in hierarchical
cluster analysis and biochemically on the eligibility and
meaningfulness of clustered templates in terms of metabolite kinetics.
PREVIOUS WORK
Metabolic concentration data used in this study have served as a
database for the development and validation of novel data mining and
biomarker discovery strategies in previously published studies by our
group. In Netzer _et al_., 2011  58  we presented a two-step
network-based approach for the identification of metabolic biomarkers,
classifying alanine, acetylcarnitine (C2), propionylcarnitine (C3),
and glycine, as strong, and arginine, citrulline, and lysine as
moderate biomarker candidates, represented as major hubs in the
dynamic network. These findings show high accordance with identified
dynamic metabolic biomarker candidates in physical activity using the
approach presented in this work, again selecting alanine,
acetylcarnitine (C2), propionylcarnitine (C3) as strong predictors,
and arginine as moderate marker candidate.
In a second paper  59  we introduced a method for biomarker
identification by inferring two different types of networks, i.e.,
correlation networks and ratio networks. This more theoretical
approach calculates scores to prioritize features using topological
descriptors. Groups of obese test persons (with a body mass index
(BMI) > 30) and healthy controls were compared in this study, which
identified highly discriminatory biomarker candidates, i.e.,
histidine, ornithine, acetylcarnitine (C2), and proline.
CONCLUSIONS
In this article, we have presented a computational methodology for
dynamic biomarker classification and modeling of kinetic metabolic
patterns in physical activity. Insight into kinetic regulatory
mechanisms could be provided by characterizing specific kinetic
signatures for selected key metabolites within the groups of
acylcarnitines and amino acids, and for glucose. A new data analysis
strategy for the characterization and classification of dynamic
biomarker candidates was introduced. We were able to specify common
kinetic shape templates, identified from groups of metabolites showing
a similar characteristic in dynamic time-course responses. Findings
demonstrated high accordance with previously published data and
established biochemical knowledge, e.g., the response of glucose,
showing a behavior similar to a hockey stick function with a delayed
increase in concentration after the end of physical exercise during
the recovery phase.
Due to the selected study design of a cycle ergometry experiment, in
which physical exercise was increased incrementally (every 3 minutes
by 25 W), known kinetic patterns could be partly confirmed by our
observations, in particular in response to the selected workload
protocol. Major impact of the presented methodology can be seen in the
fact that kinetic mechanisms in metabolism could be qualified and
quantified not only through a “strong” mathematical model, but by
an empiric deduction and description of _de facto_ kinetic response
patterns from quantitated metabolic time-course concentration data,
measured under _in-vivo_ experimental conditions.
A further direction of research might be the analysis of additional
classes of metabolites and the description and interpretation of
kinetic patterns subsequent to active exercise in the recovery phase.
Especially for glucose—which increases rapidly in concentration
within the analyzed interval of the recovery phase—a prolonged
examination time would be highly interesting, since glucose might be
expected to be classified as strong predictor. From the computational
viewpoint, a very challenging task would be the development of
_in-silico_ pathway models, integrating the identified kinetic
signatures into a theoretical mathematical model for hypothesis
generation and verification (see e.g., Teusink _et al_., 2000  60 ).
The development of a kinetic model based on an ordinary differential
equations (ODEs) description including kinetic parameters selected
from our research might be an aim for additional research which,
however, is beyond the scope of this article.
The approach presented in this work also shows high potential for
contributing to other application areas such as pathophysiology and
pharmacodynamics. In pharmacodynamics and toxicology (particularly in
chronic toxicity testing), for instance, it might be applied to assess
treatment effects more accurately by profiling metabolite levels over
time instead of looking at end-points only (see  29 ). In many complex
diseases, the dynamic analysis may well identify more meaningful
biomarkers and reveal a deeper insight into the actual
pathomechanisms. To name one important example that is actually very
close to the present study: in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), physical exercise—and bicycle ergometry in particular—is
commonly used to assess the severity of the disease and also to model
exacerbations of the patients’ condition  61,62 . In this setting, a
dynamic depiction of the metabolic changes clearly has the potential
to resolve regulatory mechanisms and distinguish cause and effect of
the observed alterations (Christian Schudt, personal communication).
This is especially plausible for the pathway leading to the synthesis
of inflammation mediators such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes,
thromboxanes etc., which is closely associated with the pathology of
the disease and depends on the release of polyunsaturated fatty acids
from phospholipids in a stoichiometric manner  63–66 .
In this article, main focus was put on the development of a
computational methodology to examine longitudinal metabolic
concentration data and to present a basic approach for the
mathematical modeling and statistical analysis of dynamic kinetic
metabolic mechanisms. As previously stated (see section Methodology),
individual metabolic response patterns are partly influenced by
different factors such as physical fitness and training status,
anthropometric parameters or dietary habits. Because of limitations in
the specification and verification of the observed metabolic kinetic
patterns, a further research goal might be to systematically
investigate the underlying metabolic and physiological regulatory
mechanisms by conducting additional hypothesis-driven prospective
cohort studies. Furthermore, an extension of this paper is planned
that will compare specific groups of interest, e.g., defined with
regard to training status (response in lactate increases) or
anthropometric characteristics.
Referring to the practical execution of exercise physiology
experiments, it should be noted that most commonly only one blood
sample is collected, usually after the end of exercise. However, the
results of the presented work clearly demonstrate that characterized
metabolites show a very differential kinetic characteristic during
physical activity. Consequently one-point measurements may lead to
misinterpretations and emphasize an obvious need for multiple
measurements in exercise physiology (typically before, multiple times
during, and after exercise).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
ETHICS STATEMENT
This study was conducted in full accordance with the principles
expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was
obtained from all study participants, together with a detailed
questionnaire on nutrition and health status. In addition, a physician
subjected all individuals to a detailed examination to ensure that
they could undergo the cycle ergometry test without health risks, and
this physician was also present at all times during the exercise to
monitor the electrocardiogram (ECG) that was continuously recorded.
All laboratory work and data analysis was conducted anonymously.
EXPERIMENTAL STUDY DESIGN
In this work, longitudinal metabolic concentration data were obtained
through clinical exercise testing using a cycle ergometry stress test.
General guidance for clinical exercise testing can be found in
"Guidelines for Clinical Exercise Testing Laboratories"  67  and
"Recommendations for Clinical Exercise Laboratories"  68 . General
recommendations for cycle ergometry studies were described by Driss &
Vandewalle, 2013  69 , providing technical and clinical protocols
including limitations for study design and execution. The overall
cycle ergometry experiment was designed as a longitudinal biomarker
cohort study, with 47 persons divided into 4 different groups, i.e.,
male and female individuals, with either average physical activity or
competitive athletic activity. Study participants included amateur
endurance athletes (16 males / 8 females) and professional alpine
skiers (11 males / 12 females). The anthropometric characteristics of
the study participants (age, body mass index (BMI), height, and
weight) are summarized in Table 3. Detailed information on
anthropometric data, the general training status, and the physical
load during the cycle ergometer experiment are provided as supporting
information (S3 File).

CLINICAL STUDY EXECUTION
The workload of the cycle ergometry test was increased incrementally
by 25 W every 3 minutes up to the individual’s maximum physical load
(the basic scheme of the study protocol is depicted in S1 Fig). The
initial workload level of 25 W was skipped for all individuals,
starting the exercise with a workload of 50 W. The lowest observed
maximum workload was 150 W (one individual), and the highest workload
level was 425 W, also reached by one individual. From each individual
blood samples for metabolite profiling were taken (i) at rest
(directly before starting the exercise), (ii) with each new workload
level up to individual’s maximum physical load, and (iii) after a
short recovery phase of five minutes after the maximum workload
(highest Watt level). In addition, for all test subjects, lactate
concentrations were measured as a gold standard and reference for
assessing physical activity. Concentration-time curves of preprocessed
lactate data are visualized in S2 Fig. Median values of lactate
concentrations were roughly 1.2 mM at rest, 8.5 mM at maximum
workload, and 7.2 mM after recovery. According to the study protocol,
lactate samples were taken at 1:30 min, samples for metabolite
profiling at 2:30 min after starting a new ergometry workload level.
All samples were taken from the earlobe, collected as dried blood
spots (DBS)  57  and analyzed under standardized study conditions.
TARGETED METABOLITE QUANTITATION
In metabolomics, two basic conceptual approaches are used: untargeted
and targeted metabolite profiling methods. Untargeted metabolomics
seeks to create a holistic picture of metabolism by trying to identify
a comprehensive set of metabolites as a snapshot of a metabolic state,
while targeted metabolomics aims at a quantitation of pre-selected
metabolites defined by _a priori_ knowledge  70,71 . The two
state-of-the-art technologies for analyzing metabolites are nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy  72  and mass spectrometry (MS)
 73 . Dynamic time-course metabolic concentration values, building the
basis for data analysis and modeling in this work, were gathered from
a targeted metabolomics approach  70,74,75 , using triple quadrupole
tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)  76  coupled with the concept of
stable isotope dilution (SID)  77  for metabolite quantitation.
MEASURED METABOLITE CONCENTRATIONS
Longitudinal metabolite concentration data were quantified for three
classes of metabolites: acylcarnitines, amino acids, and sugars. In
total, 110 metabolites were measured: 40 acylcarnitines, 18 amino
acids, and 52 sugars. Quantitated concentration data of all measured
metabolites were thoroughly examined with respect to data quality
assurance and reliability. Metabolites either below the detection
limit (LOD) of 50 nM, measurements with lots of missing values or wide
variabilities were excluded from this analysis. As result, targeted
concentration data of a selected set of 30 metabolites are considered
for data analysis in this work: 11 acylcarnitines, 18 amino acids, and
1 sugar. Analyzed acylcarnitines include: carnitine (C0),
acetylcarnitine (C2), propionylcarnitine (C3), methylmalonylcarnitine
(C3-DC-M), butyrylcarnitine (C4), valerylcarnitine (C5),
hydroxyvalerylcarnitine (C5-OH), hexadecanoylcarnitine (C16),
octadecanoylcarnitine (C18), octadecenoylcarnitine (C18:1), and
octadecadienylcarnitine (C18:2). Amino acids are: alanine, arginine,
aspartic acid, citrulline, glutamic acid, glycine, histidine, lysine,
methionine, ornithine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine,
tryptophan, tyrosine, valine, and xleucine (the sum of leucine and
isoleucine). Analyzed metabolite within the class of sugars was
glucose. Collected data were almost complete, except some missing data
at individual’s maximum load (twelve individuals, however lactate
could be measured after 1:30 min for all of them), and at 150 W for
one test person (no. 9).
DATA ANALYSIS WORKFLOW
Central steps of the selected data analysis workflow include the
technical validation of raw data, preprocessing of data, selection of
putative dynamic biomarker candidates, mathematical modeling and
characterization of metabolite kinetic patterns, identification of
metabolite groups with similar kinetic behavior, specification of
observed kinetic shape templates, classification of dynamic biomarker
candidates and the biochemical interpretation of findings. A flowchart
of the used data analysis workflow is shown in Fig 6, representing the
whole data-driven process for the discovery of biomarkers in
metabolomics. Results from the different steps of the data analysis
workflow are exemplarily shown and visualized for glucose, a key
analyte, playing a central role in metabolism of exercise physiology
and demonstrating a very specific kinetic pattern in response to
physical activity.

2008  42 ). Intermediate discovery steps include the technical

kinetic patterns, identification of metabolite groups with similar
kinetic behavior, specification of observed kinetic shape templates,
classification of dynamic biomarker candidates, and subsequently the
biochemical interpretation of findings.
RAW DATA—DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION
Raw data of the cycle ergometry experiment were test-wise reviewed and
visualized in two different basic ways to obtain a better
understanding about the nature of the metabolic time-course data.
Concentration data were initially analyzed by building subsets of
data, referring to the levels of each individual’s maximum physical
load. For each subset a box plot was generated, visualizing the
specific measurements (data points of the horizontal axis) versus the
metabolite concentrations (see section Clinical study execution). In
S3 Fig, resulting box plots for glucose are exemplarily shown. Eight
box plots were generated, where the lowest value of individual maximum
workload (150 W) resulted in 7 data points (1 test person) and the
highest value (425 W) in 18 measurement points (1 test person).
Second, analyzed metabolites were visualized as raw concentration
curves (exemplarily shown for glucose in S4 Fig), illustrating
differences in individual workload and time of exercise of examined
test persons. The horizontal axis hereby represents time points of
measurements in minutes.
DATA PREPROCESSING
Different lengths of metabolic concentration-time curves, resulting
from the variability of each individual’s maximum physical load,
were made comparable by rescaling the data in time (S5 Fig).
Measurement at rest was defined as 0%, maximum workload of each
individual as 100% and recovery value as median value of
117%—resulting in an aligned workload curve to a uniform length.
This requires additional data points added to the concentration curves
using a linear interpolation approach (Fig 7A).

GLUCOSE CONCENTRATION CURVES.
A) Concentration curves of all test persons after linear
interpolation. B) Box plot representation of concentration curves of
all test persons.
Metabolic concentration-time curves underwent simple descriptive
analysis by generating a box plot representation from rescaled
concentration curves (Fig 7B). In a next step, median concentration
values were extracted from interpolated concentration curves (S6 Fig),
serving as a basis for mathematical modeling by curve fitting (see
section Mathematical modeling). This approach perfectly treats the
problem of outliers in the data without the need of applying
additional methods for outlier detection and removal. However, a small
set of extreme outliers was observed that was manually removed after
careful visual inspection (in test person no. 14 all data points at
recovery, in test person no. 35 all data points at 175 W and in test
person no. 42 the data point for glucose at rest). Regarding missing
concentration values it should be noted that our dataset was almost
complete, except missing values at individuals’ maximum workload in
12 test persons and at 150 W in one individual (no. 9), representing
the last data points in the concentration time curves.
MAXIMUM FOLD CHANGES AND STATISTICAL HYPOTHESIS TESTING
Maximum fold changes in metabolite concentrations and _P_-values of
statistical hypothesis testing serve as a score for the ranking of
putative biomarker candidates (see section Selection of dynamic
biomarker candidates). The combination of fold changes and _P_-values,
visualized using a volcano plot, is described in the literature as
method of choice for the analysis and visualization of significant
changes (e.g., on microarray data  78,79  or in diverse metabolomics
applications  80–82 ). As a general approach, especially in genomics
studies, this method is usually used for data comparing the starting
and end point of dynamic processes such as regulation of gene
expression.
In this work, utilizing longitudinal time course concentration data,
MFCs are calculated by the difference between observed minimum and
maximum concentration values of a metabolite, independently from their
timely occurrence. MFCs are calculated based on median concentration
values extracted from interpolated concentration curves (see section
Data preprocessing). Measurement indices are determined, and
consequently, if the minimum concentration occurs earlier in the time
course, the ratio of maximum concentration to minimum concentration is
calculated and vice versa. This modality is summarized in the
following pseudo-code:
_if (conc_min_index < conc_max_index)_
maximum_fold_change=conc_max/conc_min
(5)
_else_
maximum_fold_change=conc_min/conc_max
(6)
_P_-values of statistical hypothesis testing are calculated in a
similar way, first by determining measurement index positions of
minimum and maximum median concentration values of interpolated
concentration curves and in a subsequent step, by extracting
interpolated individual concentration values at identified index
positions as basis for statistical hypothesis testing. Interpolated
minimum and maximum concentration values of all 30 metabolites were
assessed with respect to their density distribution by visual
inspection using graphical methods such as histogram analysis  83  and
quantile-quantile plots  84 . A Shapiro-Wilk Normality test was
applied for normality testing of both minimum and maximum
concentration data (significance level _P_ = 0.01)  85–87 .
Metabolites hereby yielded inhomogeneous distributions (e.g., normal
distribution for histidine, octadecanoylcarnitine (C18) or glycine,
non-normal distribution e.g., for xLeucine, citrulline or proline, and
partly differences in distributions between minimum and maximum
concentrations, e.g., for arginine). To ensure comparability between
metabolites, a Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test  88  (non-parametric
hypothesis test for paired samples) was used for the calculation of
_P_-values (significance level _P_ = 0.001). Since ranks are used for
paired hypothesis testing, identical _P_-values are partly shown for
some metabolites. Finally, calculated _P_-values were adjusted
according to the false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple
comparisons  89 .
MATHEMATICAL MODELING
The initial goal of our work was the mathematical modeling of
metabolite kinetic patterns and shape templates, utilizing a set of
predefined mathematical basis functions  29 . However, the
introduction of predefined basic functions for the analysis of dynamic
metabolomics data is and remains a challenge as also discussed by
Smilde _et al_., 2010  29 . Note that putative basic functions in this
work are associated with kinetic patterns in response to linear
increasing physical activity and can be basically classified into the
following set of shape templates:
a sustained response pattern, showing a mainly constant concentration
over time, overlaid with biological or instrument noise, represented
e.g., by a constant function 
f(x)=c
(7) 
an early response pattern, with an early significant change in
concentration, mathematically described e.g., by a logarithmic
function 
f(x)=ln(x)
(8) 
a halving interval response, showing a change in concentration at the
half time of exercise with a following plateau, represented e.g., by a
sigmoid basis function 
f(x)=1(1+e−t)
(9) 
a late response, with a continuous decrease/increase up to the end of
physical activity, described e.g., by a linear, a quadratic, or an
exponential function 
f(x)=cx
(10) 
f(x)=x2
(11) 
f(x)=ex
(12) 
a delayed response pattern, showing first a sustained characteristic
followed by a strong response after the end of physical exercise
during the recovery phase, mathematically represented by a so-called
L-curve or hockey stick function  90,91 .
Fitting the above-introduced basic functions to measured
concentration-time curves was thoroughly examined and tested with the
goal to characterize kinetic response patterns according to these
theoretical models. In this analysis curve fitting was performed using
median metabolite concentration values, extracted from interpolated
concentration-time curves (see section Data preprocessing). Our
preliminary results demonstrated that the approach of fitting the
pre-defined set of mathematical basis functions was not feasible for
the measured response curves caused by an incremental increase of
physical workload. We therefore revised our initial concept by
utilizing polynomial fitting of preprocessed data. This modality
enables us to design kinetic response patterns that are
physiologically reasonable and relevant. Polynomials of degree _n_ are
defined by following equation:
f(x)=∑i=0naixi
(13)
After testing different polynomial degrees, we decided for a degree of
nine, showing the best results in terms of curve/shape representation
and smoothness (S7 Fig). To ensure comparability of analyzed
metabolites after polynomial fitting, relative concentration values
were calculated (in percentage of concentration changes with respect
to the initial concentration at rest) (see Fig 4).
Note that there are multiple applications in metabolomics using
polynomial fitting, e.g. for baseline correction  92,93 , prediction
of germination curves  94 , calculation of mass correction profiles
 95  or in spectrum deconvolution  96 .
HIERARCHICAL CLUSTER ANALYSIS
Metabolite groups, showing similar kinetic response patterns, were
examined and identified using hierarchical cluster analysis  97 .
Cluster analysis was performed based on the concentration values of
the fitted polynomials of 9th degree (see section Mathematical
modeling).
Results are visualized as a heatmap in Fig 8. Relative workload values
of the x-axis are displayed in linear order. Red colors indicate lower
values in dynamic time-course concentrations of specific metabolites,
lighter colors indicate higher concentration values. The resulting
cluster dendrogram is separately shown in S8 Fig. Clusters of
metabolites, showing similar dynamic behavior, were empirically
identified by cutting the hierarchical tree at a threshold of 35,
resulting in seven different metabolite clusters (see section
Identification of metabolite groups with similar patterns).

Colored heatmap, visualizing the results of hierarchical cluster
analysis. Concentration values are scaled and centered for each
metabolite by row, resulting in an improved color representation.
Relative workload values (x-axis) are visualized in linear order,
resulting in a colored representation of the polynomially fitted
concentration curves for each metabolite.
Descriptive statistical analysis for each cluster was performed and
corresponding box plots were generated (S9 Fig). Median concentration
curves of each cluster, allowing for an accurate representation and
specification of kinetic shape templates, were selected (S10 Fig) (see
section Specification of kinetic shape templates).
