ABSTRACT
(1) Background: We have been using the Sportomics approach to evaluate
biochemical and hematological changes in response to exercise. The aim
of this study was to evaluate the metabolic and hematologic responses
of world-class canoeists during a training session; (2) Methods: Blood
samples were taken at different points and analyzed for their
hematological properties, activities of selected enzymes, hormones,
and metabolites; (3) Results: Muscle stress biomarkers were elevated
in response to exercise which correlated with modifications in the
profile of white blood cells, where a leukocyte rise was observed
after the canoe session. These results were accompanied by an increase
in other exercise intensity parameters such as lactatemia and
ammonemia. Adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol increased during
the exercise sessions. The acute rise in both erythrocytes and white
blood profile were probably due to muscle cell damage, rather than
hepatocyte integrity impairment; (4) Conclusion: The cellular and
metabolic responses found here, together with effective nutrition
support, are crucial to understanding the effects of exercise in order
to assist in the creation of new training and recovery planning. Also
we show that Sportomics is a primal tool for training management and
performance improvement, as well as to the understanding of metabolic
response to exercise.

1. INTRODUCTION
Physical stress response due to a sport challenge is implicated in
many metabolic modifications which affect the equilibrium of the
biochemical internal environment  1,2 . This includes changes in the
amount and kinetics of diverse biomarkers that are correlated with
exercise intensity and muscle damage  3,4 . Some of these changes in
metabolism can be assessed using blood as a biological matrix. For
more than one decade, our group has dedicated research efforts towards
understanding changes in metabolism using exercise as an
induced-stress metabolic model  3,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16 . The
Sportomics approach targets metabolic and signaling molecule
evaluations during either mimicked or real conditions faced in sports
situations; it combines “-omics” technique with classic clinical
laboratory analyses in order to understand sport-induced modifications
 16 . These approaches represent a powerful tool to understand changes
in physical and metabolic stress  17,18,19  and allow researchers to
propose interventions in order to optimize athletes’ performance
 5,20,21 . The approach is also a useful investigation tool for
studying the effects of nutrition supplementation on physical training
in different physiological or clinical conditions, such as type 2
diabetes mellitus  22 . Therefore, the analysis of world-class
athletes in a field perspective allows us the possibility of
understanding metabolic and signaling responses during high metabolic
stress. Similar to a personalized-medicine approach, the Sportomics
method allows us to better understand individual changes and to
propose individualized interventions.
Several recent investigations have focused on the ammonemia changes
resulting from a physical effort, which may be modified due to
different causes  23,24,25 . Amino acids play a central metabolic role
as an energetic source during exercise, which requires their
deamination in order to be transduced into chemical energy. Increased
muscle contraction rate also can contribute to changes in ammonemia,
through adenosine monophosphate (AMP) deamination  26,27,28,29 .
During intense or prolonged exercise, the reduced ability to
resynthesize ATP promotes accumulation of ammonia and inosine
monophosphate (IMP) which is metabolized to urate  30 . An intensity
relationship has been proposed between ammonemia and exercise, as
ammonia rapidly increases at intensities greater than 50%–60% of
VO2max  31,32 . However, ammonia production and release is not solely
restricted to intense exercise. During prolonged (>1 h) submaximal
exercise (60%–75% VO2max), ammonia could be produced through the
breakdown of branched chain amino acid (BCAA) for additional energy
provision  33,34,35 .
Ammonia may cross the blood brain barrier causing neurotoxic effects
including neuropsychiatric disorders, convulsion, and death  36 , and
may be implicated in central fatigue  25 . Therefore, ammonia
accumulation may be avoided through a detoxification system. Humans
convert ammonia to urea mainly in hepatocytes, and different cells can
decrease ammonemia by synthesizing amino acids as a mechanism for
further excretion of urea  9,11,37 . Therefore, an increase in urea
levels reflects both AMP and amino acid deamination. On the other
hand, urate is the final metabolite of the purine metabolism; hence,
its measure can be stoichiometrically related to IMP deamination.
Since urea and urate are, respectively, the final products of ammonia
and purine metabolism, the study of the kinetics of those blood
analytes leads to a better understanding of the metabolic pathways of
ammonia origin and the response to exercise  37 . For this reason, our
group has proposed nutritional and training interventions to promote
metabolic adaptations in elite athletes to enhance their performance
in training and competitions  3,10 .
Canoeing has been featured as an Olympic sport since the Summer
Olympic Games of 1936 in Berlin. Currently, men´s and women’s
competitions cover distances of 200 m, 500 m, and 1000 m either solo,
in pairs, or in crews of four. Canoeing contests are sprint events
requiring sustained bursts of speed and power, leading to intense
mechanical and metabolic stress. Little is known about these
athletes’ metabolic responses during training sessions or
competitions, therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate four
world-class canoeists during a training session through a Sportomics
approach. As far as we know, this is the first metabolic investigation
in the field, coming from our unique opportunity to investigate
world-class athletes. This investigation will help enlighten us about
the metabolism behavior in elite athletes.
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study assessed the metabolic response of four male world-class
canoeists during a combined training session. All athletes were
currently engaged in international elite competitions (including world
championships, Pan-American, and Olympic games). During the trials,
the athletes were instructed to maintain their typical hydration and
food ingestion habits. Additionally, clinical evaluation,
anthropometric measurements, and laboratory tests of collected blood
samples were performed to assess health status. A Sportomics
evaluation and analysis was performed to understand the metabolic
effects of a training session. Subjects were fully instructed about
the testing procedures and each signed a written informed consent.
This study was conducted according to all procedures involving human
subjects approved by the Ethics Committee for Human Research at the
Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro (117/2007, renewed
in 2011, 2013 and 2016) and met the requirements regulating research
on human subjects (Health National Council, Brazil, 1996) the proper
written informed consent was read and signed by the athletes.
2.1. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS
After a regular warm up, the athletes were subjected to a training
protocol that consisted of several canoe sprint bouts, with three
minute intervals between each bout, covering different distances and
intensities. The total distance totaled 16 kilometers. This first part
of the protocol had a duration of 210 min followed by a rest period of
20 min during which they ingested a 500 mL beverage consisting of
about 20% carbohydrate (short and medium absorption); 2% lipids; 5%
proteins (casein and whey proteins). Next, they performed a weight
lifting training session for 50 min focusing on exercises that recruit
large muscle groups for both upper and lower body, followed by a 70
min of recovery. See the experimental trial depicted (Figure 1).

Experimental trial. Blood samples of the athletes were collected at
the time points indicted in the Figure and as described in materials
and methods.
2.2. BLOOD COLLECTION
Blood samples were collected following an antecubital vein puncture
before (T1) and after (T2) the 16 km canoe training session; before
(T3) and after (T4) the resistance training; and after the recovery
period (T5) (Figure 1). Samples for hematological analysis assays were
collected into tubes with K2-EDTA (Vacuette, Greiner Bio-One,
Frickenhausen, Germany). White blood cell (total and differential),
erythrocyte, and thrombocyte counts were measured in whole blood
within a two-hour time frame after collection. Blood was immediately
centrifuged to obtain either plasma or serum that was aliquoted,
centrifuged (3000× _g_; 10 min; 4 °C), and stored in liquid nitrogen
for later analysis (never more than eight hours). Samples were
analyzed in duplicate or triplicate, when necessary, and measured
against a standard curve with no less than five points.
2.3. BLOOD ANALYSIS
A range of hematological and biochemical analyses was carried out
totalizing around 100 analytes. The large amount of data generated was
used in a non-target analysis linked to an ex-post facto study design.
We chose near 20 analytes that could be relevant for our study of the
athlete’s performance. Among others, our data set included a broad
spectrum of metabolites and biomarkers related to different cellular
and systemic signaling processes like inflammation and both muscle and
hepatic injury.
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST),
alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH),
γ-glutamyltransferase (γGT), creatine phosphokinase muscle-brain
fraction (CKMB), creatine phosphokinase (CK), ammonia, urea, blood
urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, urate, glucose, lactate, and
2-hydroxybutyrate were measured by the enzymatic kinetic method  38 
in an automatic analyzer (ADVIA 1200—SIEMENS, Erlangen,
Germany/Autolab 18 Boehringer Mannheim, Ingelheim am Rhein, Germany).
Myoglobin was evaluated by the Hybridization Signal Amplification
Method  39 . Albumin and total protein were assessed by
electrophoretic analysis  40 . High-density lipoprotein (HDL),
low-density lipoprotein (LDL), very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL),
total lipids, triacylglycerols (TG), and total cholesterol were
assessed by the Chabrol & Charonnat method  41 . Amino acids were
measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)  42 .
CKMB-mass, insulin, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and cortisol
levels were assessed by chemiluminescence (Immulite 2000 Siemens,
Erlangen, Germany)  43 .
2.4. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical analyses were performed using the software SigmaPlot 11.0
integrated with SigmaStat 3.5 packages (Systat, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
Due to the nature of the experiment, including the similarity of
subjects and the controlled experimental conditions (diet, sleep,
training and major physical condition variables), the data were
expressed as mean ± standard error (SEM). Data were normalized to
pre-training results (T1) for clarity and analyzed by Analysis of
Variance (ANOVA) using the condition and time as the repeated measured
variables, which were confirmed using Tukey’s post hoc test. _p_ <
0.05 was defined as the limit for statistically different mean values.
3. RESULTS
Anthropometric characteristics of the individuals are presented on
Table 1. Approximate averages of the values measured were as follows:
1.77 m of height, 82.9 kg of weight, 9.8 kg of fat weight, 73 kg of
fat-free mass, 11.5% of body fat percentage, indicating that all
tested individuals presented typical body composition, fat
distribution, and weight profiles. We assessed the lipid profiles and
serum protein levels of the individuals to characterize their
nutritional status. As observed in Table 2, the assessed lipid
profiles were in accordance with the healthy status of the general
population. Table 3 presents the results regarding serum protein
levels. Despite the fact that these data are considered normal values
for the general population, it is worth noting that the assessed
albuminemia was low considering a world-class team of athletes. Due to
the lack of knowledge of world-class biomarker levels we chose to show
all the data as a reference for future studies  3,5,10,21 .

3.1. MUSCLE STRESS BIOMARKERS
Well-established metabolic stress biomarkers were assessed in order to
characterize the training intensity of the proposed trial. Compared to
basal levels, AST showed a statistically significant increase after
the resistance training (T4) by 30%, and continued to increase by up
to 40% after the recovery period. Other biomarkers, such as ALT, ALP,
and γGT, did not change throughout the trial (Figure 2, panels A and
B). CK activity in blood samples, a classic muscle injury marker, was
significantly higher by approximately 60% at T4. Compared to the
pre-exercise state, it kept increasing to nearly two-fold at T5
(Figure 3, panel A). Despite the fact that no significant change was
observed in CKMB and LDH blood activity, the CKMB mass activity, a
very specific muscle injury parameter, reached an increment of 170% at
T4 and was up regulated by three-fold at T5 (Figure 3, panel A). Blood
levels of myoglobin were significantly increased after the first
session of exercise, with an increment of 170%, and kept increasing
throughout the trial to reach six-fold values at T5 when compared to
basal (Figure 3, panel B).

3.2. WHITE BLOOD CELLS
During the trial, blood leukocytes rose by 40.0% ± 16.1% and 62.1% ±
26.8% after the canoe (T2) and weight lifting (T4) sessions,
respectively, showing a discrete decrease after recovery and reaching
levels of 43.2% ± 21.5% higher than basal. These results were mainly
due to the increment in the neutrophil count, which showed a
significant increase by 54.3% ± 22.3% and 166.2% ± 71.4% after T2
and T4, respectively, and was still 136.0 ± 58.2 higher than basal
levels after the recovery. Despite the slight increase after the canoe
training, the levels of lymphocytes showed a significant decrease of
approximately 40% after the 20 min rest between the training sessions
and remained significantly lower until the end of the protocol (Figure
4). Eosinophils measurements tended to accompany the lymphocytes
pattern, presenting an increment of approximately 30% at T2 followed
by an acute reduction that remained until the trial was terminated.
Monocytes acutely responded to exercise stress and the recovery
periods, increasing by about 30% after both exercise sessions with a
rapid restoration of the original values. Thrombocyte levels responded
positively and significantly to the canoe training sessions; they
increased 30% compared to the control at T2, acutely returned to basal
levels after the 20 min rest prior following resistance training, and
remained similar to the original value for the rest of the trial
(Figure 5).

3.3. BRANCHED CHAIN AMINO ACIDS
Plasma branched chain amino acids (BCAA), which are important
substrates either as metabolic fuel or as protein synthesis
precursors, decreased right after both physical stimuli. Leucine
showed the most prominent, significant decrease after the canoe
training, reaching almost 50% of the basal value, and continued to
decrease by approximately 22% after the resistance training. These
decreases did not return to the original values, even after the
recovery period. Both isoleucine and valine plasma concentrations
seemed to be down regulated after canoe training, however, this
decrease was not significantly different. After the 20 min rest
between training sessions their levels returned to original values
(Figure 6, panel A).

(_p_ < 0.05).
3.4. AROMATIC AMINO ACIDS
The three amino acids comprising the aromatic amino acids (AAA),
phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine, are ketoglucogenic amino acids
that may be deviated to the gluconeogenic pathway in hepatocytes. Our
results showed that these amino acids decreased in the range of
15%–25% after both the canoe and the weight lifting exercises
(Figure 6, panel B).
3.5. GLUCONEOGENIC AMINO ACIDS
Many amino acids may serve as both substrates in anaplerotic reactions
replenishing intermediates of the tricarboxylic cycle and as
gluconeogenic substrates. Hence, many amino acids serve as energy
sources in metabolic pathways. Interestingly, the plasma concentration
of some of these amino acids increased right after the first exercise
bout. Alanine showed a two-fold increment after the canoe training and
also showed a slighter increment of approximately 20% at T4, after
resistance training. Glutamate was up regulated by 63% at T2, but
regained the original levels at T4. Ornithine plasma levels were
enhanced by approximately 20% at T2. Methionine was elevated by
approximately 86% after the canoe training session and decreased for
the remainder of the trial. Taurine followed the methionine response,
which is one of its precursors, rising 56% at T2. Glycine showed a
later increase, with levels elevated by about 35% at T3 and with
measurements similar to control at all other time points. On the other
hand, arginine blood levels were down regulated to 60% of control
values at T2 and 69% at T4. Glutamine presented a similar but slighter
response, reaching 85% of basal values at T2 and returning to control
levels thereafter. Lysine showed an approximately 30% decremented
level at T2 when compared to control. Other assessed amino acids, such
as asparagine, aspartate, serine, and threonine, did not fluctuate
throughout the trial.
3.6. METABOLIC PATHWAY SUBSTRATES, INTERMEDIATES, AND PRODUCTS
The metabolism of amino acids results in the production of nitrogen
compounds, including ammonia; the increase in the levels of these
compounds in the blood is tightly related to exercise intensity and
duration. Ammonemia was significantly up regulated after the canoe
training session by 78% and remained significantly enhanced (by about
71%) even after the recovery period. Urea blood level was slightly
higher by about 21% at T4 and tended to reach normal values after the
recovery period. Urea concentration may reflect total ammonia
excretion. IMP production is correlated to urate appearance in the
blood, which is the final product of purine catabolism. Urate blood
concentration rose significantly in blood by 24% and 20% at T4 and T5,
respectively, when compared to the control. Blood levels of
creatinine, a muscle damage indicator that may also suggest
hemoconcentration alteration, responded acutely to both exercise
sessions, augmenting significantly by 24% at T2. This was followed by
a restoration of control values at T3, then a significant enhancement
right after resistance training by 20% when compared to the control,
and then a return to normal values at the end of the recovery period
(Figure 7). BUN concentration remained unchanged throughout the trial.

methods and are shown as mean ± standard error of percentage values
against control.   Indicates statistical difference against control
values (_p_ < 0.05).
Serum glucose, insulin, ACTH, and cortisol fluctuations during
exercise are also related to the destinations of amino acid
metabolites and, therefore, were measured. Due to the stress caused by
the canoe training session, the hypothalamus activated the production
of Corticotropin Releasing Hormone (CRH), which in turn stimulated the
anterior pituitary gland to produce ACTH, and then the adrenal gland
to produce cortisol. While ACTH serum levels increased by 82% at T2,
cortisol rose only 12% in comparison to initial levels. After
exercise, the HPA axis was suppressed, and blood levels of both
hormones diminished significantly when ACTH reached values of 36% at
T4, and measured cortisol was 39% at T5 when compared to T2 (Figure
8).

significance when compared to T5 values (_p_ < 0.05).
Insulin presented a slight decrease in response to the canoe exercise
by about 10% and a significant increase of 137% after the 20 min of
rest due to the food and hydro-electrolyte reposition; it returned to
the approximate basal levels after the resistance training session and
presented a drop by 50% of the original concentration. Glycemia was
significantly enhanced by 78% after the canoe bout and tended to
decrease progressively throughout the trial while maintaining its
blood level slightly higher than basal. The ketone body
2-hydroxybutyrate blood levels were also significantly augmented after
the canoe bout by 29%, followed by a slighter increment of 11% after
the second exercise training session (Figure 9, panels A and B). It is
well known that the lactate blood levels increase according to the
exercise intensity. Our results showed a significant increment of 360%
and 255% after the canoe and resistance training sessions,
respectively (Figure 9, panel A).

4. DISCUSSION
Canoeing competitions are sprint events requiring sustained bursts of
speed and power, leading to intense biochemical and metabolic stress.
Many metabolites produced due to physical effort may be implicated in
fatigue and impairment of physical performance, hence, the
understanding of these responses is crucial to upgrade training
sessions and optimize athlete performance. Here, we applied a
Sportomics approach to study and evaluate different metabolic and
cellular responses during a training session of world-class canoe
athletes. Sportomics can help us in the understanding of the
metabolism and signaling events that occur in response to exercise and
allow us to perform interventions increasing both metabolic and
sportive performances  10,16,19 .
We measured serum levels of known exercise intensity biomarkers to
characterize the applied training protocol magnitude and assure the
possibility of correlating exercise intensity to the metabolic
responses. Exercise intensity can be inferred by increases in plasma
levels of CK, CKMB mass, CKMB, and LDH  3,44,45,46 . Several studies
have investigated the increase in CK in response to exercise
 3,5,10,21 . In this study, CK and CKMB mass blood levels increased
continuously throughout the exercise trial, rising significantly at T4
and T5 when compared to basal levels. This suggests that the exercise
stress and duration represented enough stimuli to cause such changes;
a similar result was described by Siegel et al.  47 . Despite these
observations, CKMB levels did not elevate significantly at any time
point throughout the exercise session. However, it is worth noting
that the blood basal levels of this enzyme were higher than expected
due to exercise accumulation along the regular training season of the
athletes, and this fact may have limited the furthest increment along
the executed protocol. Additionally, immune assays show more
analytical sensitivity when compared to enzymatic activity
measurements. Therefore, it is necessary to separate immune assays
from enzymatic assays. It is important to emphasize that most
protocols measure the enzymatic activity of CK (also LDH and others)
as a way to understand its increase or decline in response to
exercise. These enzymes are also being subjected to blood environment
changes that can lead to an increase in the specific activity (i.e.,
the ability to an enzyme to catalyze a reaction in a given unit of
time), so it is our understanding that the preferable way to measure
muscle cellular injury is to use a direct measurement of the enzyme
content using immunological quantitative methods (such as ELISA or
Western blot or mass spectrometry). For us, this is an important
statement because we believe that researchers should carefully analyze
the results of any increase of enzymes during exercise by the way of
enzymatic activity.
Blood levels of LDH also remained constant throughout the exercise
trial, and this result is in accordance with other studies which have
shown a classic delayed response of LDH blood levels to strenuous
exercise  48,49,50 . Myoglobin release from muscle to blood is a
well-known biochemical marker of muscle injury  51 . In our study,
myoglobin significantly increased due to the exercise stress,
confirming skeletal muscle damage induced by the exercise protocol.
This confirms the CK findings and corroborates our interpretation
concerning the difference in the CK and CKMB increase.
Classical biochemical hepatic damage markers such as AST, ALT, ALP,
and γGT can be increased as a result of liver and/or muscle injury
after strenuous exercise  52,53 . In the present study, the only
enzyme that presented a significant increase throughout the protocol
was AST, while the serum level of the other enzymes remained unchanged
throughout the exercise. Since these enzymes are also present in
muscles, the origin of this increase could not be differentiated
between muscle or liver cell disruption. However, we have recently
proposed that muscle damage can be distinguished from liver damage by
using the more specific liver biomarkers such as ALT and γGT  5 ,
which remained constant in the present study. These data together
suggest that the increases of these proteins are more likely from
muscle rather than liver cellular injury.
White blood cell counts increase after many types of exercise and the
release of neutrophils is directly correlated with exercise intensity
and duration  3,17,18 . In this study, we reported an increment in
total leukocytes in response to both exercise sessions, which can be
attributed to the release of neutrophils. Interestingly, after a
discrete increment in lymphocyte levels at T2, it returned to basal
values and continued decreasing reaching a significant reduction
between the training sessions. Previous studies indicated that the
response of white blood cells to exercise is dependent on both
cytokine and myokines modulation  54,55,56 . Taken together these
results may suggest that white blood cell mobilization is due not to a
non-specific exercise-induced spleen release, but rather to a specific
signal. Additionally, we reported an increase in platelet count
without any change in erythrocyte count, indicating that this effect
occurs in a spleen-independent manner. As previously suggested, these
results may indicate that both thrombocytosis and leucocytosis
observed during the exercise bout are induced by either muscle cell
damage or differential cell signaling  3,18 .
Muscle cell damage is known to stimulate immune cell mobilization to
the bloodstream and migration to muscle tissue  5 . Exercise has been
proposed to be a physiological way to modulate immunity; while acute
severe exercise usually impedes immunity, chronic moderate exercise
improves it  57,58 . Although the evidence to support these concepts
is inconclusive, it supports the idea that exercise-induced immune
suppression increases susceptibility to symptoms of infection,
particularly around time of competition  59 . Moreover, metabolic
stress is correlated with exercise induced white blood cell response,
as carbohydrate supplementation and availability have been proposed to
affect neutrophil count after intense exercise  60,61,62 . We
previously described that a combination of training, rest and
nutritional intervention could have an important impact in amino acid
availability, muscle cellular injury, and immune response in another
world-class athlete  10 . Therefore, the immune responses reported
here may be directly correlated with the alterations in the
nutritional status and metabolic availability as observed during the
present experimental trial.
In this sense, it is important to maintain plasma level amino acids
during training sessions, since many amino acids serve both as
anabolic and energetic precursors. In addition, it has been proposed
that blood fluctuations in the concentration of BCAAs may affect its
ratio in the brain  63 . In our study, the levels of many amino acids
presented a blood concentration decrease during the sport trial.
Leucine showed the most important decrease after the canoe training
session. Isoleucine and valine concentration also decreased in a
smaller range. Aromatic amino acids, which are generally metabolized
in the liver, were slightly consumed during the canoe exercise
session; similar results were described before  10 . Glutamine levels
presented a similar response; they decreased after the canoe trial and
were restored after the recovery period. This could be the result of
two processes: glutamine exportation from muscle to decrease its
ammonia levels; and the use of glutamine as both a gluconeogenic
substrate and a urea cycle feeder in the liver. On the other hand,
alanine was up regulated after the first exercise bout, showing a
two-fold increment at T2. This response may be attributed to a
metabolic attempt to offer gluconeogenic substrates for further
oxidation. The depletion of glycogen storage is related to exercise
intensity, duration, and nutritional status, which in turn may
increase the use of amino acids as energy substrates, thereby
increasing ammonia and the production of other nitrogen compounds
 64 . Both glutamine and alanine are anaplerotic and gluconeogenic
substrates and contribute to ATP and glucose synthesis. The ergogenic
properties of glutamine have been extensively studied  6,62,65 , and
we have recently reported the metabolic effects of alanine in
comparison to long-term glutamine supplementation during an
intermittent exercise protocol. Long term administration of glutamine
is capable of reducing ammonia production during intermittent
exercise, hence, it is postulated to be a protector against an
increase in blood ammonia in an exercise intensity-dependent manner
 21 .
Many studies have indicated that ammonia is a useful physiological
marker of prolonged intense exercise, and its appearance in blood is
positively correlated with exercise intensity  1,10,30 . High
ammonemia can be toxic to both muscles and the central nervous system
(CNS). Such changes are believed to contribute to the disturbances in
neuropsychological function and motor control deficits and are also
observed in patients with cirrhosis and, therefore, could induce
central and peripheral fatigue  25,60,66 . Therefore, measuring
ammonia production during a sport session may represent an important
tool to control exercise intensity and to understand the metabolic
response of a given athlete. The canoe athletes experienced an
increase in their blood ammonia levels during the exercise trial due
to both stimuli, which remained up regulated even after the recovery
period. This effect was followed by an increase in other measured
nitrogenous compounds, such as urea, urate and creatinine. These
responses may have occurred as a result of an increased demand for ATP
by muscle contraction, leading to adenosine monophosphate (AMP)
deamination and, subsequently, the production of ammonia and urate
 26,27,28,29 . Many studies have shown that ammonia production and
release represents the exercise effort intensity, rapidly increasing
in intensities greater than 50%–60% of VO2max up to maximal
exhaustion  31,32 . Ammonia plasma concentration is also up regulated
during prolonged (greater than one hour) submaximal exercise
(60%–75% VO2max). In these conditions, ammonia could be produced in
increasing amounts through the breakdown of branched chain amino acid
(BCAA) prior to oxidation for additional energy provision  33,34,35 .
The response of the other nitrogen metabolites may shed light on
understanding the protein and amino acid oxidation response during
exercise. Urea and urate blood concentration is indirectly correlated
with the myokinase (adenylate kinase, ADK) contribution to ATP
synthesis. Under a resting physiological state, approximately 90% of
the skeletal muscle adenosine monophosphate deaminase (AMPD) is in a
sarcoplasmic position and in an inactive form. However, a significant
change occurs as intense muscle contraction begin, when approximately
50%–60% of AMPD becomes bound to the myofibrils  28 . Binding of the
enzyme increases its activity causing an increased rate of degradation
of AMP to IMP. This is correlated with the appearance of urate in the
blood which is a final metabolite of purine metabolism  30 . This
increased breakdown of AMP will affect the equilibrium of the ADK
reaction by creating additional ATP from ADP to increase the cellular
energy charge and maintain contractions under conditions of increasing
stress  29 . During intense exercise, when AMP production and
deamination are high, ADP levels also increase as utilization of ATP
exceeds re-phosphorylation  67 . Therefore, any strategies, such as
diet adequacies and supplementations, to protect against
hyperammonemia or an increment of any nitrogenous compound could
enhance physical performance or prevent CNS injuries, as previously
reported by our group  6,10,21 .
During the canoe trial, glycemia rose significantly, which may be a
result of the HPA axis activation. Exercise is known to be a potent
activator of this endocrine system, resulting in the release of ACTH,
as confirmed here. This ultimately culminates with glucocorticoids
production and release into blood circulation, which may lead to
gluconeogenesis activation and promotion of an adrenergic stimulus,
providing glucose to blood from hepatic glycogenolysis  68,69,70 .
Nevertheless, afferent neural feedback signals from contracting muscle
and feedback signals mediated via the blood stream can stimulate
glucose production to maintain glycemia. Therefore, central mechanisms
coupled with the degree of motor center activity can be responsible
for part of the increase in glucose mobilization, especially during
intense exercise where hepatic glucose release exceeds peripheral
glucose uptake, and plasma glucose rises  71 . Furthermore, cortisol
is implicated in exercise induced lymphocyte apoptosis, via
glucocorticoid dependent-pathways  72 , which might affect immune
function and protect the organism from an overreaction of the immune
system in the face of exercise-induced muscle damage  73 .
Hepatic glucose production increases during exercise, to cope with the
augmented demand, as a product of liver glycogenolysis and
gluconeogenesis. Whereas the former predominates during high intensity
exercise, the latter contributes substantially with prolonged exercise
and the concomitant decline in liver glycogen stores and with
increased gluconeogenic precursor supply. In fact, it has been
postulated that the increase in glucose production with exercise
intensity in healthy subjects can be entirely attributed to increases
in net hepatic glycogenolysis  74 . This pathway is also supported by
our data. On the other hand, a decline in plasma insulin is important
for the rise in glucose production during exercise  71 , due to the
fact that insulinemia tends to decrease in response to prolonged
exercise, with a more pronounced effect on athletes than untrained
individuals  75 , which is in agreement with the results reported
here.
5. CONCLUSIONS
The data presented here allow us to consider hormonal, metabolic, and
signaling response together with the knowledge of nutrition and
training environment. This combined information permits a better
understanding of the individual responses of exercise and sport
stress. Our group developed the concept of Sportomics with a focus on
bridging the same existent gap between translational and personalized
medicine  76 . As stated by Liebman et al.  77 , the workflow bench to
bedside approach is being refined in the face of a new
bedside-bench-bedside approach. Sportomics is useful to evaluate the
unprecedented kinetics of some metabolites  3,5,10,11,13,14,16,37,78 
and to shed light on the importance of in-field metabolic analyses to
the understanding of the inter-individual response to exercise.
Besides an effective nutritional support, collecting physiological
data during training and competition can provide important information
about an athlete’s clinical condition, bringing strategies to modify
metabolism during exercise as well as supporting coaches to prescribe
their sessions and recovery time. Therefore, and due to the uniqueness
of this study, we believe Sportomics is a primal tool for training
management and performance improvement, as well as for preserving
health and increasing the quality of life of athletes.
