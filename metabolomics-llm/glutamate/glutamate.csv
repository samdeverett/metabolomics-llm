AUTHOR SUMMARY
Human metabolism is controlled through basic kinetic regulatory
mechanisms, where the overall system aims to maintain a state of
homeostasis. In response to external perturbations, such as
environmental influences, nutrition or physical exercise, circulating
metabolites show specific kinetic response patterns, which can be
computationally modeled. In this work, we searched for dynamic
metabolic biomarker candidates and analyzed specific kinetic
mechanisms from longitudinal metabolic concentration data, obtained

INTRODUCTION
METABOLITE KINETICS—BIOCHEMICAL ASPECTS
Basic principles in reaction kinetics of biomolecules were described
by the work of Guldberg & Waage  1–3  more than 150 years ago and
recently resumed by Voit _et al_., 2015  4  in their perspective
article ""150 years of mass action"". The underlying concept is the law
of mass action, describing the quantitative aspects of a chemical
reaction under ideal conditions. If a substance C is formed by the
reaction of substance A and substance B, the production of C can be
described by the following equation
ProductC=k A B
(1)",breit.txt
6,0,6,"described by the following equation
ProductC=k A B
(1)
where _A_, _B_, and _C_ are concentrations changing over time, and _k_
is a rate constant describing the speed of the reaction. Probably the
most widely known and used modification of the original model in
biochemistry is the Michaelis-Menten rate law (MMRL) introduced by
Michaelis & Menten in 1913  5 
v=VmaxSKm+S
(2)
where _v_ is the reaction rate, _V_ _max_ the maximum reaction rate,
_S_ the concentration of the substrate, and _K_ _m_ the Michaelis
constant (the substrate concentration at half of the maximum reaction
rate).
The Michaelis-Menten model describes the reaction kinetics of an
enzyme-catalyzed single-substrate reaction, in which the conversion of
a substrate _S_ into a product _P_ takes place via the formation of an",breit.txt

intermediate complex _ES_, where _k_ _1_, _k_ _2_ and _k_ _3_ denote

Guldberg and Waage also examined the fact that biochemical systems
tend to remain in homeostasis, which is described by the equilibrium
constant  6 
Keq= C c D d A a B b

_K_ _eq_ is the equilibrium constant in the general reaction _aA +

of _A_, _B_, _C_, _D_ participating, and _ A _, _ B _, _ C _, _ D _
are the molar reaction concentrations of the reaction components at
equilibrium  7 .
When analyzing regulatory mechanisms of metabolite kinetics, a key
question addresses the effect of external perturbations disturbing",breit.txt

homeostasis, e.g., caused by environmental influences, nutrition, drug
interventions (pharmacodynamics) or physical activity (studied in this
work through clinical exercise testing). These effects can be measured
and examined by longitudinal cohort studies, which investigate dynamic
changes in metabolite concentrations over time.
In chronic toxicity testing, which occupies a central position in the
analysis of dynamic time-course metabolic data, studies are performed
to explore the influences of toxic substances on human or animal
metabolism. Mechanisms of metabolite kinetics are analyzed, e.g., by

biotechnological process monitoring, metabolic interactions are
analyzed, e.g., in studying the sensitivity of the biocatalyst
_Clostridium thermocellum_ to ethanol stress  13 , in exploring the
forced ageing process of Port wine  14  or by the examination and

physical exercise cover fundamental work, e.g., on studying the
influence of improved metabolic health on patterns in plasma

MODELING OF KINETIC MECHANISMS—COMPUTATIONAL ASPECTS
Regarding computational and mathematical aspects of characterizing
kinetic regulatory mechanisms, different approaches of fundamental
models for the analysis of metabolic processes have been described in
the literature: qualitative models for topological network analysis,
models of flux balance analysis using stoichiometric network
construction and detailed kinetic models representing metabolic
processes using ordinary differential equations (ODEs)  22,23 .
Furthermore, different intermediate approaches do exist, e.g., the
approach of structural kinetic modeling (SKM), approximating local",breit.txt

mechanisms in metabolism—by simulating the mitochondrial fatty acid
β-oxidation—is presented by Modre _et al_., 2009  25 . Further
examples for theoretical network models as well as dynamic kinetic

(ANOVA) type models, and methods based on imposing smoothness.
Analyses of periodic or oscillating data can be performed using
methods such as Fourier analysis, wavelet transformation or principal

statistical framework for metabolic biomarker discovery in NMR data
was presented by Berk _et al_., 2011  36 , introducing a smoothing

BIOCHEMICAL INTERPRETATION OF FINDINGS
Thanks to an elaborate body of knowledge in biochemistry, a
peculiarity within the process of data analysis in metabolomics lies
in the dedicated biochemical interpretation of results  54 . This
knowledge is nowadays annotated in public databases, e.g., the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)  55 , and eases the
interpretation of findings in the context of annotated biochemical
pathways.

free fatty acids) and amino acid metabolism  6 . During a cycle
ergometry stress test, an individual increasingly consumes adenosine
triphosphate (ATP); to compensate this energy consumption and maintain
homeostatic levels of ATP, its production is up-regulated, first
primarily by aerobic processes (respiration), and then anaerobic
fermentation. Under the low-impact conditions chosen in this study
(low initial output of 50 Watt (W) and slow increase of 25 W every
three minutes), the metabolic data demonstrate that the body uses both
glycolysis and β-oxidation of fatty acids as readily available energy",breit.txt

The findings of this work, i.e., identified biomarker candidates of
exercise metabolism, and characterized metabolite signatures via
specified kinetic shape templates, can be explained through the
metabolic regulatory mechanisms in physical activity. Significant
changes in concentrations of acetylcarnitine (C2) and closely related
short-chain acylcarnitines (C3, C4, and C5) arise from their

increased production of glucogenic amino acids through high glycolytic
activity. This connection is most obvious for alanine, which is the
corresponding amino acid of the alpha-keto acid pyruvate and is, thus,
a direct mirror of glycolytic or gluconeogenetic flux  48 . The third

levels.

for all individuals as a gold standard for profiling physical
activity. Metabolite concentrations were quantitated by a targeted
metabolomics approach, combining mass spectrometry analytics with the
concept of stable isotope dilution. From the initial set of 110
metabolites (including classes of acylcarnitines, amino acids and
sugars), we selected a reliable and quality assured set of 30

candidates, identified with the highest predictive value, yielded late
response patterns. This might be seen in the context that lactate

almost sustained response pattern before yielding an exponential
increase in concentration up to a maximum physical load. The primary

physiologically plausible metabolite kinetic patterns in physical

resulting from a slight overfitting of curves due to the chosen

Metabolic concentration data used in this study have served as a

identification by inferring two different types of networks, i.e.,
correlation networks and ratio networks. This more theoretical
approach calculates scores to prioritize features using topological

CONCLUSIONS
In this article, we have presented a computational methodology for
dynamic biomarker classification and modeling of kinetic metabolic
patterns in physical activity. Insight into kinetic regulatory
mechanisms could be provided by characterizing specific kinetic
signatures for selected key metabolites within the groups of
acylcarnitines and amino acids, and for glucose. A new data analysis
strategy for the characterization and classification of dynamic
biomarker candidates was introduced. We were able to specify common
kinetic shape templates, identified from groups of metabolites showing
a similar characteristic in dynamic time-course responses. Findings",breit.txt

demonstrated high accordance with previously published data and
established biochemical knowledge, e.g., the response of glucose,
showing a behavior similar to a hockey stick function with a delayed

the recovery phase.
Due to the selected study design of a cycle ergometry experiment, in
which physical exercise was increased incrementally (every 3 minutes
by 25 W), known kinetic patterns could be partly confirmed by our
observations, in particular in response to the selected workload
protocol. Major impact of the presented methodology can be seen in the
fact that kinetic mechanisms in metabolism could be qualified and",breit.txt

quantified not only through a “strong” mathematical model, but by
an empiric deduction and description of _de facto_ kinetic response

A further direction of research might be the analysis of additional
classes of metabolites and the description and interpretation of
kinetic patterns subsequent to active exercise in the recovery phase.
Especially for glucose—which increases rapidly in concentration
within the analyzed interval of the recovery phase—a prolonged
examination time would be highly interesting, since glucose might be

viewpoint, a very challenging task would be the development of
_in-silico_ pathway models, integrating the identified kinetic
signatures into a theoretical mathematical model for hypothesis
generation and verification (see e.g., Teusink _et al_., 2000  60 ).
The development of a kinetic model based on an ordinary differential
equations (ODEs) description including kinetic parameters selected
from our research might be an aim for additional research which,
however, is beyond the scope of this article.
The approach presented in this work also shows high potential for
contributing to other application areas such as pathophysiology and

diseases, the dynamic analysis may well identify more meaningful
biomarkers and reveal a deeper insight into the actual
pathomechanisms. To name one important example that is actually very
close to the present study: in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), physical exercise—and bicycle ergometry in particular—is
commonly used to assess the severity of the disease and also to model

This is especially plausible for the pathway leading to the synthesis
of inflammation mediators such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes,
thromboxanes etc., which is closely associated with the pathology of
the disease and depends on the release of polyunsaturated fatty acids
from phospholipids in a stoichiometric manner  63–66 .

67,0,67,"concentration data and to present a basic approach for the
mathematical modeling and statistical analysis of dynamic kinetic

individual metabolic response patterns are partly influenced by
different factors such as physical fitness and training status,

the specification and verification of the observed metabolic kinetic
patterns, a further research goal might be to systematically
investigate the underlying metabolic and physiological regulatory
mechanisms by conducting additional hypothesis-driven prospective

results of the presented work clearly demonstrate that characterized
metabolites show a very differential kinetic characteristic during
physical activity. Consequently one-point measurements may lead to
misinterpretations and emphasize an obvious need for multiple

TARGETED METABOLITE QUANTITATION
In metabolomics, two basic conceptual approaches are used: untargeted
and targeted metabolite profiling methods. Untargeted metabolomics
seeks to create a holistic picture of metabolism by trying to identify

Longitudinal metabolite concentration data were quantified for three

RAW DATA—DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION
Raw data of the cycle ergometry experiment were test-wise reviewed and
visualized in two different basic ways to obtain a better
understanding about the nature of the metabolic time-course data.
Concentration data were initially analyzed by building subsets of
data, referring to the levels of each individual’s maximum physical
load. For each subset a box plot was generated, visualizing the
specific measurements (data points of the horizontal axis) versus the
metabolite concentrations (see section Clinical study execution). In",breit.txt
81,0,81,"metabolite concentrations (see section Clinical study execution). In
S3 Fig, resulting box plots for glucose are exemplarily shown. Eight
box plots were generated, where the lowest value of individual maximum
workload (150 W) resulted in 7 data points (1 test person) and the
highest value (425 W) in 18 measurement points (1 test person).
Second, analyzed metabolites were visualized as raw concentration
curves (exemplarily shown for glucose in S4 Fig), illustrating
differences in individual workload and time of exercise of examined
test persons. The horizontal axis hereby represents time points of
measurements in minutes.

were made comparable by rescaling the data in time (S5 Fig).
Measurement at rest was defined as 0%, maximum workload of each
individual as 100% and recovery value as median value of
117%—resulting in an aligned workload curve to a uniform length.
This requires additional data points added to the concentration curves
using a linear interpolation approach (Fig 7A).

analysis by generating a box plot representation from rescaled
concentration curves (Fig 7B). In a next step, median concentration
values were extracted from interpolated concentration curves (S6 Fig),
serving as a basis for mathematical modeling by curve fitting (see
section Mathematical modeling). This approach perfectly treats the
problem of outliers in the data without the need of applying
additional methods for outlier detection and removal. However, a small
set of extreme outliers was observed that was manually removed after
careful visual inspection (in test person no. 14 all data points at

complete, except missing values at individuals’ maximum workload in
12 test persons and at 150 W in one individual (no. 9), representing
the last data points in the concentration time curves.
MAXIMUM FOLD CHANGES AND STATISTICAL HYPOTHESIS TESTING
Maximum fold changes in metabolite concentrations and _P_-values of
statistical hypothesis testing serve as a score for the ranking of
putative biomarker candidates (see section Selection of dynamic
biomarker candidates). The combination of fold changes and _P_-values,
visualized using a volcano plot, is described in the literature as",breit.txt
85,0,85,"visualized using a volcano plot, is described in the literature as
method of choice for the analysis and visualization of significant
changes (e.g., on microarray data  78,79  or in diverse metabolomics
applications  80–82 ). As a general approach, especially in genomics
studies, this method is usually used for data comparing the starting
and end point of dynamic processes such as regulation of gene
expression.
In this work, utilizing longitudinal time course concentration data,
MFCs are calculated by the difference between observed minimum and
maximum concentration values of a metabolite, independently from their
timely occurrence. MFCs are calculated based on median concentration
values extracted from interpolated concentration curves (see section",breit.txt
86,0,86,"values extracted from interpolated concentration curves (see section
Data preprocessing). Measurement indices are determined, and
consequently, if the minimum concentration occurs earlier in the time
course, the ratio of maximum concentration to minimum concentration is
calculated and vice versa. This modality is summarized in the
following pseudo-code:
_if (conc_min_index < conc_max_index)_
maximum_fold_change=conc_max/conc_min
(5)
_else_
maximum_fold_change=conc_min/conc_max
(6)
_P_-values of statistical hypothesis testing are calculated in a
similar way, first by determining measurement index positions of
minimum and maximum median concentration values of interpolated
concentration curves and in a subsequent step, by extracting",breit.txt
87,0,87,"concentration curves and in a subsequent step, by extracting
interpolated individual concentration values at identified index
positions as basis for statistical hypothesis testing. Interpolated
minimum and maximum concentration values of all 30 metabolites were
assessed with respect to their density distribution by visual
inspection using graphical methods such as histogram analysis  83  and
quantile-quantile plots  84 . A Shapiro-Wilk Normality test was
applied for normality testing of both minimum and maximum
concentration data (significance level _P_ = 0.01)  85–87 .
Metabolites hereby yielded inhomogeneous distributions (e.g., normal
distribution for histidine, octadecanoylcarnitine (C18) or glycine,
non-normal distribution e.g., for xLeucine, citrulline or proline, and",breit.txt
88,0,88,"non-normal distribution e.g., for xLeucine, citrulline or proline, and
partly differences in distributions between minimum and maximum

metabolites, a Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test  88  (non-parametric
hypothesis test for paired samples) was used for the calculation of
_P_-values (significance level _P_ = 0.001). Since ranks are used for
paired hypothesis testing, identical _P_-values are partly shown for
some metabolites. Finally, calculated _P_-values were adjusted
according to the false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple
comparisons  89 .
MATHEMATICAL MODELING

89,0,89,"metabolite kinetic patterns and shape templates, utilizing a set of
predefined mathematical basis functions  29 . However, the
introduction of predefined basic functions for the analysis of dynamic

Smilde _et al_., 2010  29 . Note that putative basic functions in this
work are associated with kinetic patterns in response to linear
increasing physical activity and can be basically classified into the
following set of shape templates:
a sustained response pattern, showing a mainly constant concentration
over time, overlaid with biological or instrument noise, represented
e.g., by a constant function

Fitting the above-introduced basic functions to measured
concentration-time curves was thoroughly examined and tested with the
goal to characterize kinetic response patterns according to these
theoretical models. In this analysis curve fitting was performed using
median metabolite concentration values, extracted from interpolated
concentration-time curves (see section Data preprocessing). Our
preliminary results demonstrated that the approach of fitting the
pre-defined set of mathematical basis functions was not feasible for
the measured response curves caused by an incremental increase of
physical workload. We therefore revised our initial concept by
utilizing polynomial fitting of preprocessed data. This modality",breit.txt

After testing different polynomial degrees, we decided for a degree of
nine, showing the best results in terms of curve/shape representation
and smoothness (S7 Fig). To ensure comparability of analyzed
metabolites after polynomial fitting, relative concentration values
were calculated (in percentage of concentration changes with respect
to the initial concentration at rest) (see Fig 4).

1. INTRODUCTION
Physical stress response due to a sport challenge is implicated in
many metabolic modifications which affect the equilibrium of the
biochemical internal environment  1,2 . This includes changes in the
amount and kinetics of diverse biomarkers that are correlated with
exercise intensity and muscle damage  3,4 . Some of these changes in
metabolism can be assessed using blood as a biological matrix. For
more than one decade, our group has dedicated research efforts towards
understanding changes in metabolism using exercise as an
induced-stress metabolic model  3,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16 . The",coelho.txt
99,1,3,"induced-stress metabolic model  3,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16 . The
Sportomics approach targets metabolic and signaling molecule
evaluations during either mimicked or real conditions faced in sports
situations; it combines “-omics” technique with classic clinical
laboratory analyses in order to understand sport-induced modifications
 16 . These approaches represent a powerful tool to understand changes
in physical and metabolic stress  17,18,19  and allow researchers to
propose interventions in order to optimize athletes’ performance
 5,20,21 . The approach is also a useful investigation tool for
studying the effects of nutrition supplementation on physical training
in different physiological or clinical conditions, such as type 2",coelho.txt
100,1,4,"in different physiological or clinical conditions, such as type 2
diabetes mellitus  22 . Therefore, the analysis of world-class
athletes in a field perspective allows us the possibility of
understanding metabolic and signaling responses during high metabolic
stress. Similar to a personalized-medicine approach, the Sportomics
method allows us to better understand individual changes and to
propose individualized interventions.
Several recent investigations have focused on the ammonemia changes
resulting from a physical effort, which may be modified due to
different causes  23,24,25 . Amino acids play a central metabolic role
as an energetic source during exercise, which requires their
deamination in order to be transduced into chemical energy. Increased",coelho.txt
101,1,5,"deamination in order to be transduced into chemical energy. Increased
muscle contraction rate also can contribute to changes in ammonemia,
through adenosine monophosphate (AMP) deamination  26,27,28,29 .
During intense or prolonged exercise, the reduced ability to
resynthesize ATP promotes accumulation of ammonia and inosine
monophosphate (IMP) which is metabolized to urate  30 . An intensity
relationship has been proposed between ammonemia and exercise, as
ammonia rapidly increases at intensities greater than 50%–60% of
VO2max  31,32 . However, ammonia production and release is not solely
restricted to intense exercise. During prolonged (>1 h) submaximal
exercise (60%–75% VO2max), ammonia could be produced through the
breakdown of branched chain amino acid (BCAA) for additional energy",coelho.txt
102,1,6,"breakdown of branched chain amino acid (BCAA) for additional energy
provision  33,34,35 .
Ammonia may cross the blood brain barrier causing neurotoxic effects
including neuropsychiatric disorders, convulsion, and death  36 , and
may be implicated in central fatigue  25 . Therefore, ammonia
accumulation may be avoided through a detoxification system. Humans
convert ammonia to urea mainly in hepatocytes, and different cells can
decrease ammonemia by synthesizing amino acids as a mechanism for
further excretion of urea  9,11,37 . Therefore, an increase in urea
levels reflects both AMP and amino acid deamination. On the other
hand, urate is the final metabolite of the purine metabolism; hence,
its measure can be stoichiometrically related to IMP deamination.",coelho.txt
103,1,7,"its measure can be stoichiometrically related to IMP deamination.
Since urea and urate are, respectively, the final products of ammonia
and purine metabolism, the study of the kinetics of those blood
analytes leads to a better understanding of the metabolic pathways of
ammonia origin and the response to exercise  37 . For this reason, our
group has proposed nutritional and training interventions to promote
metabolic adaptations in elite athletes to enhance their performance
in training and competitions  3,10 .

requiring sustained bursts of speed and power, leading to intense

world-class canoeists during a training session through a Sportomics
approach. As far as we know, this is the first metabolic investigation
in the field, coming from our unique opportunity to investigate

also showed a slighter increment of approximately 20% at T4, after
resistance training. Glutamate was up regulated by 63% at T2, but
regained the original levels at T4. Ornithine plasma levels were
enhanced by approximately 20% at T2. Methionine was elevated by
approximately 86% after the canoe training session and decreased for
the remainder of the trial. Taurine followed the methionine response,

hand, arginine blood levels were down regulated to 60% of control
values at T2 and 69% at T4. Glutamine presented a similar but slighter
response, reaching 85% of basal values at T2 and returning to control
levels thereafter. Lysine showed an approximately 30% decremented
level at T2 when compared to control. Other assessed amino acids, such
as asparagine, aspartate, serine, and threonine, did not fluctuate

4. DISCUSSION
Canoeing competitions are sprint events requiring sustained bursts of
speed and power, leading to intense biochemical and metabolic stress.
Many metabolites produced due to physical effort may be implicated in
fatigue and impairment of physical performance, hence, the
understanding of these responses is crucial to upgrade training",coelho.txt
134,1,38,"understanding of these responses is crucial to upgrade training
sessions and optimize athlete performance. Here, we applied a
Sportomics approach to study and evaluate different metabolic and
cellular responses during a training session of world-class canoe
athletes. Sportomics can help us in the understanding of the
metabolism and signaling events that occur in response to exercise and
allow us to perform interventions increasing both metabolic and
sportive performances  10,16,19 .
We measured serum levels of known exercise intensity biomarkers to
characterize the applied training protocol magnitude and assure the
possibility of correlating exercise intensity to the metabolic
responses. Exercise intensity can be inferred by increases in plasma",coelho.txt
135,1,39,"responses. Exercise intensity can be inferred by increases in plasma
levels of CK, CKMB mass, CKMB, and LDH  3,44,45,46 . Several studies
have investigated the increase in CK in response to exercise
 3,5,10,21 . In this study, CK and CKMB mass blood levels increased
continuously throughout the exercise trial, rising significantly at T4
and T5 when compared to basal levels. This suggests that the exercise
stress and duration represented enough stimuli to cause such changes;
a similar result was described by Siegel et al.  47 . Despite these
observations, CKMB levels did not elevate significantly at any time
point throughout the exercise session. However, it is worth noting
that the blood basal levels of this enzyme were higher than expected",coelho.txt
136,1,40,"that the blood basal levels of this enzyme were higher than expected
due to exercise accumulation along the regular training season of the
athletes, and this fact may have limited the furthest increment along
the executed protocol. Additionally, immune assays show more
analytical sensitivity when compared to enzymatic activity
measurements. Therefore, it is necessary to separate immune assays
from enzymatic assays. It is important to emphasize that most
protocols measure the enzymatic activity of CK (also LDH and others)
as a way to understand its increase or decline in response to
exercise. These enzymes are also being subjected to blood environment
changes that can lead to an increase in the specific activity (i.e.,
the ability to an enzyme to catalyze a reaction in a given unit of",coelho.txt
137,1,41,"the ability to an enzyme to catalyze a reaction in a given unit of
time), so it is our understanding that the preferable way to measure
muscle cellular injury is to use a direct measurement of the enzyme
content using immunological quantitative methods (such as ELISA or
Western blot or mass spectrometry). For us, this is an important
statement because we believe that researchers should carefully analyze
the results of any increase of enzymes during exercise by the way of
enzymatic activity.
Blood levels of LDH also remained constant throughout the exercise
trial, and this result is in accordance with other studies which have
shown a classic delayed response of LDH blood levels to strenuous
exercise  48,49,50 . Myoglobin release from muscle to blood is a",coelho.txt
138,1,42,"exercise  48,49,50 . Myoglobin release from muscle to blood is a
well-known biochemical marker of muscle injury  51 . In our study,
myoglobin significantly increased due to the exercise stress,
confirming skeletal muscle damage induced by the exercise protocol.
This confirms the CK findings and corroborates our interpretation
concerning the difference in the CK and CKMB increase.
Classical biochemical hepatic damage markers such as AST, ALT, ALP,
and γGT can be increased as a result of liver and/or muscle injury
after strenuous exercise  52,53 . In the present study, the only
enzyme that presented a significant increase throughout the protocol
was AST, while the serum level of the other enzymes remained unchanged
throughout the exercise. Since these enzymes are also present in",coelho.txt
139,1,43,"throughout the exercise. Since these enzymes are also present in
muscles, the origin of this increase could not be differentiated
between muscle or liver cell disruption. However, we have recently
proposed that muscle damage can be distinguished from liver damage by
using the more specific liver biomarkers such as ALT and γGT  5 ,
which remained constant in the present study. These data together
suggest that the increases of these proteins are more likely from
muscle rather than liver cellular injury.
White blood cell counts increase after many types of exercise and the
release of neutrophils is directly correlated with exercise intensity
and duration  3,17,18 . In this study, we reported an increment in
total leukocytes in response to both exercise sessions, which can be",coelho.txt
140,1,44,"total leukocytes in response to both exercise sessions, which can be
attributed to the release of neutrophils. Interestingly, after a
discrete increment in lymphocyte levels at T2, it returned to basal
values and continued decreasing reaching a significant reduction
between the training sessions. Previous studies indicated that the
response of white blood cells to exercise is dependent on both
cytokine and myokines modulation  54,55,56 . Taken together these
results may suggest that white blood cell mobilization is due not to a
non-specific exercise-induced spleen release, but rather to a specific
signal. Additionally, we reported an increase in platelet count
without any change in erythrocyte count, indicating that this effect",coelho.txt
141,1,45,"without any change in erythrocyte count, indicating that this effect
occurs in a spleen-independent manner. As previously suggested, these
results may indicate that both thrombocytosis and leucocytosis
observed during the exercise bout are induced by either muscle cell
damage or differential cell signaling  3,18 .
Muscle cell damage is known to stimulate immune cell mobilization to
the bloodstream and migration to muscle tissue  5 . Exercise has been
proposed to be a physiological way to modulate immunity; while acute
severe exercise usually impedes immunity, chronic moderate exercise
improves it  57,58 . Although the evidence to support these concepts
is inconclusive, it supports the idea that exercise-induced immune
suppression increases susceptibility to symptoms of infection,",coelho.txt
142,1,46,"suppression increases susceptibility to symptoms of infection,
particularly around time of competition  59 . Moreover, metabolic
stress is correlated with exercise induced white blood cell response,
as carbohydrate supplementation and availability have been proposed to
affect neutrophil count after intense exercise  60,61,62 . We
previously described that a combination of training, rest and
nutritional intervention could have an important impact in amino acid
availability, muscle cellular injury, and immune response in another
world-class athlete  10 . Therefore, the immune responses reported
here may be directly correlated with the alterations in the
nutritional status and metabolic availability as observed during the
present experimental trial.",coelho.txt
143,1,47,"nutritional status and metabolic availability as observed during the
present experimental trial.
In this sense, it is important to maintain plasma level amino acids
during training sessions, since many amino acids serve both as
anabolic and energetic precursors. In addition, it has been proposed
that blood fluctuations in the concentration of BCAAs may affect its
ratio in the brain  63 . In our study, the levels of many amino acids
presented a blood concentration decrease during the sport trial.
Leucine showed the most important decrease after the canoe training
session. Isoleucine and valine concentration also decreased in a
smaller range. Aromatic amino acids, which are generally metabolized
in the liver, were slightly consumed during the canoe exercise",coelho.txt
144,1,48,"in the liver, were slightly consumed during the canoe exercise
session; similar results were described before  10 . Glutamine levels
presented a similar response; they decreased after the canoe trial and
were restored after the recovery period. This could be the result of
two processes: glutamine exportation from muscle to decrease its
ammonia levels; and the use of glutamine as both a gluconeogenic
substrate and a urea cycle feeder in the liver. On the other hand,
alanine was up regulated after the first exercise bout, showing a
two-fold increment at T2. This response may be attributed to a
metabolic attempt to offer gluconeogenic substrates for further
oxidation. The depletion of glycogen storage is related to exercise
intensity, duration, and nutritional status, which in turn may",coelho.txt
145,1,49,"intensity, duration, and nutritional status, which in turn may
increase the use of amino acids as energy substrates, thereby
increasing ammonia and the production of other nitrogen compounds
 64 . Both glutamine and alanine are anaplerotic and gluconeogenic
substrates and contribute to ATP and glucose synthesis. The ergogenic
properties of glutamine have been extensively studied  6,62,65 , and
we have recently reported the metabolic effects of alanine in
comparison to long-term glutamine supplementation during an
intermittent exercise protocol. Long term administration of glutamine
is capable of reducing ammonia production during intermittent
exercise, hence, it is postulated to be a protector against an
increase in blood ammonia in an exercise intensity-dependent manner

146,1,50,"increase in blood ammonia in an exercise intensity-dependent manner

Many studies have indicated that ammonia is a useful physiological
marker of prolonged intense exercise, and its appearance in blood is
positively correlated with exercise intensity  1,10,30 . High
ammonemia can be toxic to both muscles and the central nervous system
(CNS). Such changes are believed to contribute to the disturbances in
neuropsychological function and motor control deficits and are also
observed in patients with cirrhosis and, therefore, could induce
central and peripheral fatigue  25,60,66 . Therefore, measuring
ammonia production during a sport session may represent an important
tool to control exercise intensity and to understand the metabolic",coelho.txt
147,1,51,"tool to control exercise intensity and to understand the metabolic
response of a given athlete. The canoe athletes experienced an
increase in their blood ammonia levels during the exercise trial due
to both stimuli, which remained up regulated even after the recovery
period. This effect was followed by an increase in other measured
nitrogenous compounds, such as urea, urate and creatinine. These
responses may have occurred as a result of an increased demand for ATP
by muscle contraction, leading to adenosine monophosphate (AMP)
deamination and, subsequently, the production of ammonia and urate
 26,27,28,29 . Many studies have shown that ammonia production and
release represents the exercise effort intensity, rapidly increasing
in intensities greater than 50%–60% of VO2max up to maximal",coelho.txt
148,1,52,"in intensities greater than 50%–60% of VO2max up to maximal
exhaustion  31,32 . Ammonia plasma concentration is also up regulated
during prolonged (greater than one hour) submaximal exercise
(60%–75% VO2max). In these conditions, ammonia could be produced in
increasing amounts through the breakdown of branched chain amino acid
(BCAA) prior to oxidation for additional energy provision  33,34,35 .
The response of the other nitrogen metabolites may shed light on
understanding the protein and amino acid oxidation response during
exercise. Urea and urate blood concentration is indirectly correlated
with the myokinase (adenylate kinase, ADK) contribution to ATP
synthesis. Under a resting physiological state, approximately 90% of",coelho.txt
149,1,53,"synthesis. Under a resting physiological state, approximately 90% of
the skeletal muscle adenosine monophosphate deaminase (AMPD) is in a
sarcoplasmic position and in an inactive form. However, a significant
change occurs as intense muscle contraction begin, when approximately
50%–60% of AMPD becomes bound to the myofibrils  28 . Binding of the
enzyme increases its activity causing an increased rate of degradation
of AMP to IMP. This is correlated with the appearance of urate in the
blood which is a final metabolite of purine metabolism  30 . This
increased breakdown of AMP will affect the equilibrium of the ADK
reaction by creating additional ATP from ADP to increase the cellular
energy charge and maintain contractions under conditions of increasing",coelho.txt
150,1,54,"energy charge and maintain contractions under conditions of increasing
stress  29 . During intense exercise, when AMP production and
deamination are high, ADP levels also increase as utilization of ATP
exceeds re-phosphorylation  67 . Therefore, any strategies, such as
diet adequacies and supplementations, to protect against
hyperammonemia or an increment of any nitrogenous compound could
enhance physical performance or prevent CNS injuries, as previously
reported by our group  6,10,21 .
During the canoe trial, glycemia rose significantly, which may be a
result of the HPA axis activation. Exercise is known to be a potent
activator of this endocrine system, resulting in the release of ACTH,
as confirmed here. This ultimately culminates with glucocorticoids",coelho.txt
151,1,55,"as confirmed here. This ultimately culminates with glucocorticoids
production and release into blood circulation, which may lead to
gluconeogenesis activation and promotion of an adrenergic stimulus,
providing glucose to blood from hepatic glycogenolysis  68,69,70 .
Nevertheless, afferent neural feedback signals from contracting muscle
and feedback signals mediated via the blood stream can stimulate
glucose production to maintain glycemia. Therefore, central mechanisms
coupled with the degree of motor center activity can be responsible
for part of the increase in glucose mobilization, especially during
intense exercise where hepatic glucose release exceeds peripheral
glucose uptake, and plasma glucose rises  71 . Furthermore, cortisol",coelho.txt
152,1,56,"glucose uptake, and plasma glucose rises  71 . Furthermore, cortisol
is implicated in exercise induced lymphocyte apoptosis, via
glucocorticoid dependent-pathways  72 , which might affect immune
function and protect the organism from an overreaction of the immune
system in the face of exercise-induced muscle damage  73 .
Hepatic glucose production increases during exercise, to cope with the
augmented demand, as a product of liver glycogenolysis and
gluconeogenesis. Whereas the former predominates during high intensity
exercise, the latter contributes substantially with prolonged exercise
and the concomitant decline in liver glycogen stores and with
increased gluconeogenic precursor supply. In fact, it has been
postulated that the increase in glucose production with exercise",coelho.txt
153,1,57,"postulated that the increase in glucose production with exercise
intensity in healthy subjects can be entirely attributed to increases
in net hepatic glycogenolysis  74 . This pathway is also supported by
our data. On the other hand, a decline in plasma insulin is important
for the rise in glucose production during exercise  71 , due to the
fact that insulinemia tends to decrease in response to prolonged
exercise, with a more pronounced effect on athletes than untrained
individuals  75 , which is in agreement with the results reported
here.

161,2,5,1 Introduction,danaher.txt
162,2,6,"High intensity exercise (HIE), defined as exercise performed at ≥80 % of an individual’s VO2max (Romijn et al. 1993), has gained increasing popularity. One reason for its popularity, especially in a time poor society, is the numerous health and fitness benefits that can be obtained from performing short bouts of exercise, albeit at a higher intensity (Gibala et al. 2012). Previous work has shown that when total workload is matched while exercise intensity (HIE versus endurance) and duration are varied (2.5 vs. 10.5 h for HIE and endurance exercise, respectively), similar physiological and cellular adaptations can occur (Gibala et al. 2006). Furthermore, our group recently confirmed these findings by demonstrating comparable changes in systemic markers of lipolysis and fat oxidation during",danaher.txt
163,2,7,"by demonstrating comparable changes in systemic markers of lipolysis and fat oxidation during the recovery period following workload matched low volume HIE and continuous (CON) exercise (Gerber et al. 2014). However, despite the two protocols being isoenergetic, plasma hypoxanthine accumulation and urinary purine base excretion was higher following the HIE, compared to the CON exercise (Gerber et al. 2014). As these degradation products of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are considered an indirect indication of ATP loss from the muscle, we suggested that the energy required for subsequent restorative processes (via intramuscular purine de novo replacement) may in part contribute to the negative energy balance that leads to fat loss often observed following long term HIE training programs",danaher.txt
164,2,8,energy balance that leads to fat loss often observed following long term HIE training programs (Gerber et al. 2014).,danaher.txt
165,2,9,"In addition, although HIE favors carbohydrate utilization relative to fat as a fuel source during exercise, evidence suggests that the muscle adaptations that occur during recovery following HIE may induce greater fat oxidation post exercise when compared to low to moderate bouts of exercise (Trapp et al. 2008; Tremblay et al. 1990; van Loon et al. 2001; Yoshioka et al. 2001). Higher relative fat oxidation post exercise could also be a contributing factor in the fat loss observed following HIE training. These findings and others (Gibala et al. 2012; Malatesta et al. 2009) indicate that training programs of high intensity and low volume may be very effective at stimulating metabolic disturbances that induce enhanced weight loss resulting from in the form of reduced adipose tissue, but also",danaher.txt

167,2,11,"To explore the aforementioned concepts further, given most research in this area only compares HIE to submaximal exercise, our laboratory examined altered exercise intensity and subsequent passive rest periods at a supramaximal level to establish whether skeletal muscle metabolism could be further manipulated at higher exercise intensities. Using three isoenergetic supramaximal low volume HIE protocols (150, 200 and 300 % of VO2peak) and selecting specific metabolites that relate to glycolysis and purine metabolism, we showed no differences in plasma inosine, xanthine and uric acid following the three workload matched protocols, but significant differences in plasma lactate area under the curve calculations and urinary hypoxanthine excretion (data not shown). These findings indicate that",danaher.txt

These findings indicate that a stimulus threshold may exist for specific metabolites when supramaximal intensity exercise is performed and going above this threshold may not induce any greater physiological change or further stimulate already maximal adaptations rates (i.e., a “biological ceiling”) proposed by Booth & Watson (1985). However, since research to date has been highly selective with respect to the metabolites monitored, changes in other important metabolites and pathways are likely to be missed.",danaher.txt
169,2,13,"Metabolomics, defined as “the quantitative measurement of the dynamic multiparametric metabolic response of living systems to pathophysiological stimuli or genetic modification” involves characterizing and quantifying a large number of metabolites and other small molecules that are present in a biological sample at one time (Nicholson et al. 1999). As such, metabolomics can provide a metabolite “signature” or “fingerprint” of the relative concentrations of multiple metabolites which can better predict phenotypic changes from genotypes (Barabasi and Oltvai 2004).

3. DISCUSSION
The aim of the current study was to determine an untargeted metabolic
response to an 80.5 km treadmill-based ultramarathon. The observed
clear separation between baseline samples (pre 80.5 km) and samples
taken immediately on completion of the distance (post 80.5 km) with",howe.txt
277,3,32,"taken immediately on completion of the distance (post 80.5 km) with
the use of a PCA model demonstrated that there were significant
metabolic changes induced by the extreme exercise of ultramarathon
running. For some metabolites, the changes were very large and were
highly significant when the two cohorts were compared (Table 1). The
major changes concern fatty acid metabolism, with a large elevation in
acylcarnitine levels in plasma for a wide range of these compounds.
The impact of exercise on carnitines has been observed before in a
number of studies  36,37,38,39,40 . A possible explanation is that the
carnitines reflect mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation as an energy
source under the impact of exercise. This is of interest since",howe.txt
278,3,33,"source under the impact of exercise. This is of interest since
acylcarnitine accumulation has been identified during prolonged
fasting and similar increased demands on stored energy  39  would be
expected in an ultra-marathon event. The elevations in fatty acids are
supported by previous findings  41  where it was demonstrated that
elevated rates of fat oxidation and ability to maintain glycogen
concentrations were found in highly trained ultra-endurance athletes.
It was shown in the metabolic response to a 24 h ultra-marathon run
that there was an increased lipid profile with substrate utilization
shift towards fat oxidation  24  suggesting reduction in
cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk  42 . More recently it has been
hypothesized that acyl carnitines have neuroactive properties that can",howe.txt
279,3,34,"hypothesized that acyl carnitines have neuroactive properties that can
regulate exertion via interaction with the neurons regulating muscle
activity  40 . Less frequently studied are the products of fatty acid
oxidation that accumulate in plasma during exercise  43,44 . Many
oxidized fatty acids have potent effects on blood vessels promoting
either vasodilation or vasoconstriction  45 . As observed (Table 1 and
Figure S81) there is a complex mixture of fatty acids all of which are
greatly elevated in plasma following exercise. The oxidation products
of linoleic acid 9-hydroxylinoleic acid and 13-hydroxylinoleic acid
have been proposed as markers of oxidative stress following exercise
and several isomers of hydroxylinoleic acids were elevated in the",howe.txt
280,3,35,"and several isomers of hydroxylinoleic acids were elevated in the
post-80.5 km samples in comparison to baseline (Table 1). This
supports the findings of previous studies that have demonstrated
ultra-endurance exercise-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production  46 . Figure S81 shows extracted ion chromatograms for the
pre- and post- levels of oxidized octadecadienoic acid. The range of
oxidized fatty acids elevated post-exercise is extensive and the
increases very marked (Table 1), therefore the elevation of
hydroxyoctadecadienoicacids is not exclusive and there are many other
hydroxy acids which are elevated post-exercise plus some dioic acids.
Whether or not these acids also have biological activities is unknown,
as is the precise reason for their elevation. When the heat map",howe.txt
281,3,36,"as is the precise reason for their elevation. When the heat map
(Figure 3) is considered it is evident that many of the oxidized fatty
acids, although elevated (Table 1), are of relatively low abundance.
It has been suggested that oxidized acids are a marker of oxidative
stress  43,44  but it might be expected that other readily oxidized
acids present in plasma, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), might
also be oxidized in the same way, but despite EPA being relatively
abundant in the plasma, no peaks for hydroxy EPAs can be seen.
Therefore, it is possible that there is some biological mechanism that
keeps oxidation products of EPA at low levels since many of these
metabolites have potent anti-inflammatory and vasoactive effects  47 .",howe.txt
282,3,37,"metabolites have potent anti-inflammatory and vasoactive effects  47 .
Although oxidative stress was not measured in the current study,
previous studies have demonstrated ultra-marathon running induces
reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and markers of oxidative
damage  48  and this warrants further investigation.

Given the wide range of unsaturated fatty acids and hydroxylated fatty",howe.txt
283,3,38,"Given the wide range of unsaturated fatty acids and hydroxylated fatty
acids (Table 1) it would seem likely that these compounds arise from
peroxisomal metabolism and this might provide a protective mechanism
for ensuring that the levels of oxidized long-chain unsaturated acids
are kept at low levels. Peroxisomes are known to be responsible for
degrading prostaglandins  49 . Unlike mitochondrial beta-oxidation of
fatty acids, peroxisomal beta-oxidation of fatty acids does not
necessarily go to completion and acids may only be shortened by 3–4
cycles of 2 carbon chain shortening  49  yielding a molecule of acetyl
CoA/acetyl carnitine at each cycle. For instance, it might be
significant that hexadecadienoic acid, tetradecadienoic acid and",howe.txt

dodecadiencoic acid are all elevated, these are not abundant naturally
occurring fatty acids, but they are all products of chain shortening
of linoleic acid via beta-oxidation  49 . Similarly, hexdecatrienoic
acid could arise from chain shortening of linolenic acid via one
beta-oxidation step. The reason for the metabolism pausing when a
double bond is encountered within the fatty acid chain is that at this
point further metabolism requires the commitment of nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide phosphate, (NADPH) in the reduction of the double
bond before further chain shortening can occur  49 . Under conditions
of aerobic stress there will be generally a high requirement for NADPH",howe.txt
285,3,40,"of aerobic stress there will be generally a high requirement for NADPH
in countering oxidative stress; it is required for instance in the
recycling of glutathione disulfide back to glutathione. The elevated
levels of acylcarnitines are consistent with increased beta-oxidation
of fatty acids by peroxisomes since they are the major product
exported out of peroxisomes resulting from fatty acid beta-oxidation.
It has previously been demonstrated that physical exercise increases
peroxisome levels in rat heart  50 . Acetyl carnitine is readily
utilized by mitochondria as a source of acetyl CoA, which can be
metabolized via the Krebs cycle. The major question with regard to
carnitines is; are they waste products or utilizable as substrates for",howe.txt
286,3,41,"carnitines is; are they waste products or utilizable as substrates for
further oxidation? Conversion of acylCoAs to acylcarnitines is
necessary in order to preserve free levels of CoA within the
mitochondria  51 . The heat map (Figure 3) indicates in terms of
absolute abundance that the common dietary fatty acids are much higher
in plasma than the unusual acids, which are promoted by exercise
observed in the current study. Thus, it seems probable that medium
chain length unsaturated fatty acids are minor metabolites due to
partial metabolism of long-chain unsaturated fatty acids by
peroxisomes providing an additional source of acetylcarnitine for
export to mitochondria. The heat map (Figure 4) shows the relative
abundance of the 40 most abundant acyl carnitines in plasma. Acetyl",howe.txt
287,3,42,"abundance of the 40 most abundant acyl carnitines in plasma. Acetyl
carnitine is highly abundant while the carnitines corresponding to the

levels of some acyl carnitines rise in urine post-exercise they do not
increase to the same extent as the plasma levels in the current study
and no increase in post-exercise urinary acetyl carnitine was observed
previously  25 . This suggests that the carnitines may be produced for
utilization as energy substrates. Conversion of free fatty acids to
acyl CoAs requires the investment of a molecule of adenosine
triphosphate (ATP). However, acyl carnitines are an activated form of

107), Yellow = 5 × 104 and blue = 5 × 103.
Therefore, the pattern of fatty acids and carnitines observed in the
current study points strongly towards a large increase in peroxisomal
metabolism. For example, a widely studied substrate of peroxisomal",howe.txt
289,3,44,"metabolism. For example, a widely studied substrate of peroxisomal
metabolism is phytanic acid, which is present in dairy products  50 .
This compound undergoes α-oxidation in the peroxisomes producing
pristanic acid, which is then further metabolized by the peroxisomes
yielding propanolyl CoA (carnitine) and dimethyl nonanoyl CoA
(undecanoyl carnitine) after six cycles of beta oxidation. Both of
these carnitines are elevated in the post-80.5 km samples and provide
potential substrates for mitochondrial metabolism in the muscles.
The increased activity of the peroxisomes is further underlined by
elevated levels of some dioic acids (Table 1), which are also only
produced by peroxisomes. The hypothesis that the metabolite patterns",howe.txt
290,3,45,"produced by peroxisomes. The hypothesis that the metabolite patterns
are consistent with peroxisomal proliferation is consistent with our
earlier observations where it was proposed that exercise increased the
proliferation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ
ligands in plasma  53 . From the current study, these ligands might
well be long-chain unsaturated fatty acids, which are substrates for
peroxisomal metabolism as discussed above.
The levels of almost all the amino acids in the plasma samples
decreased significantly. The fall in the amino acids used in protein
biosynthesis might be due to an increase in protein biosynthesis
during exercise, which was observed to occur  54,55 . Hydrocortisone

291,3,46,"is responsible for maintaining a homeostasis under stress conditions,
in this study both hydrocortisone and its metabolite urocortisone are

The most studied metabolites with regard to the effect of exercise and
the determination of fitness are metabolites in the purine pathway
such as hypoxanthine and inosine; a marked change in levels of
hypoxanthine was observed in the present study. The re-uptake of
hypoxanthine into muscle was observed to be more efficient in highly
trained individuals  58  and the elevation of hypoxanthine in plasma
during exercise is less marked than we observed in urine samples taken
post-exercise  25 . However, since the athletes in the current study",howe.txt
292,3,47,"post-exercise  25 . However, since the athletes in the current study
were trained, it might be expected that their metabolism be geared to
conserving purines  59 . Future research is also warranted to
determine the long-term adaptations to ultramarathon training. Changes
in uridine following exercise have been observed previously and most
often increases have been observed, in the current case there was a
marked decrease  60 . Changes in tocopherols have also been observed
previously in exercise studies and γ-tocopherol has been correlated
to V˙O2max level  37 . In summary, many amino acids were lowered in

medium-chain and oxidized fatty acids formed is that the prolonged
exercise provoked the proliferation of peroxisomes. The peroxisomes
may serve two functions, one of providing a readily utilizable form of
energy through formation of acetyl carnitine and other acyl carnitines
for export to mitochondria in the muscles; which can utilize these
substrates without investment of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)

To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to provide
evidence of the metabolic profile in response to prolonged
ultramarathon running using an untargeted approach. The findings
provide an insight to the effects of ultramarathon running on the
metabolic specificities and alterations that may demonstrate
cardio-protective effects.

311,4,4,"interest in high-intensity exercise as an effective mode of exercise training has intensified over the past decade in recognition of three main factors that are commonly cited as limitations to regular physical activity: lack of time, lack of motivation, and chronic diseases that restrict work capacity during exercise (64). This type of training generally consists of relatively brief, intermittent exercise performed either at “all-out” effort or at intensities close to maximum oxygen consumption (V̇o2 max) (16). The body of literature supporting the health and fitness benefits of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) is expanding. So too is our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that accompany adaptations to this form of training (19).",peake.txt
312,4,5,"Improved metabolism is integral to the benefits of HIIT. Carbohydrate (CHO) oxidation increases with exercise intensity, whereas fat oxidation increases during exercise up to 65–75% V̇o2 max and decreases at higher workloads (52, 60). Exercise also stimulates amino acid metabolism in skeletal muscle and plasma (3, 4), but the effects of exercise intensity are not well established (55). During recovery from exercise, circulating fatty acids and CHO and fat oxidation remain elevated for several hours (22). However, the effects of prior exercise intensity and modality (i.e., intermittent vs. continuous) on substrate metabolism after exercise are currently unclear (30, 31, 36, 63).",peake.txt

Most research in this area has focused on short intervals of 30 s; however, several other studies have investigated the effects of longer intervals lasting 2–4 min (2, 21, 57, 65). Markers of mitochondrial biogenesis increase to a similar extent after these forms of exercise, both acutely (2, 17) and chronically (7).

Coupled with the greater availability and ease-of-use of mass-spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance equipment, we now have better access to powerful data acquisition and advanced data-processing techniques to identify large numbers of analytes simultaneously in biological specimens (48). Metabolomics and proteomics were first applied to exercise studies on animals (5) and then humans (51). These early studies helped to refine these techniques for use in exercise research but did not yield any detailed information on specific metabolic responses to exercise (51).

DISCUSSION",peake.txt
368,4,61,"In this study, we systematically compared the metabolic and hormonal responses to matched-work high-intensity interval and continuous moderate-intensity exercise. CHO oxidation, plasma glucose, and lactate were markedly higher after high-intensity interval exercise compared with continuous moderate-intensity exercise, whereas fat oxidation and total serum NEFA were not significantly different between the two exercise trials. Targeted metabolomic analysis of plasma samples revealed detailed insights into the exercise intensity-dependent changes in TCA cycle intermediates, specific NEFA, and amino acids. Although there was no significant difference in total serum NEFA between the two trials after exercise, we did notice some differences in the abundance of individual fatty acids. This",peake.txt
369,4,62,"after exercise, we did notice some differences in the abundance of individual fatty acids. This finding highlights the importance of considering more than changes in total serum NEFA when evaluating the metabolic demands of exercise. The significant increase in TCA cycle intermediates suggests that during exercise these metabolic compounds spill over from muscle into the circulation and/or are released systemically from other metabolic organs (e.g., the liver). The individual NEFA that were most responsive to exercise were not necessarily the most abundant NEFA in plasma. This finding raises some questions about the factors that determine the preference(s) for mobilization of NEFA during exercise. Furthermore, the changes in the percentage molar distribution of NEFA contrast with previous",peake.txt
370,4,63,"Furthermore, the changes in the percentage molar distribution of NEFA contrast with previous findings after exercise and challenge the previously held notion that changes in plasma NEFA composition reflect the composition of adipose tissue. These metabolic changes were accompanied by changes in counterregulatory hormones, some of which increased only after HIIT. Collectively, these findings highlight the value of targeted metabolomics to obtain more detailed and specific information on metabolic responses to exercise beyond basic measures of substrate oxidation, glucose, and free fatty acids.",peake.txt
371,4,64,"TCA intermediates, including citric acid (1.8-fold), succinic acid (3.0-fold), aconitic acid (2.0-fold), and malonic acid (1.6-fold), all increased in plasma during high-intensity interval exercise in the present study. Of the TCA intermediates, only succinic acid increased in response to moderate-intensity exercise, and this response was considerably lower than the response following high-intensity interval exercise. Others have reported an increase in urinary citrate and α-ketoglutarate (48), urinary succinate (12), plasma/serum succinate, malate, fumarate, citrate-isocitrate, aconitic acid, and α-ketoglutarate (34, 42) after exercise.

372,4,65,"and fumarate (but not citrate-isocitrate, aconitic acid, or α-ketoglutarate) were higher in plasma from fast marathon runners compared with slow marathon runners. This finding also provides some indirect evidence of the intensity-dependent changes in these TCA intermediates after exercise that we observed. The biological role (if any) of TCA intermediates in urine and plasma after exercise is unclear because they are primarily active in skeletal muscle (14, 15) and the liver (24) during exercise. It is likely that the presence of TCA intermediates in urine and plasma after exercise likely reflects “spillover” from skeletal muscle or the liver.",peake.txt
373,4,66,"The intensity-dependent increase in plasma TCA intermediates in the present study agrees with other reports that the concentration of TCA intermediates in skeletal muscle also increases with exercise intensity (15). The increase in the concentration of TCA intermediates in skeletal muscle, and possibly plasma too, during high-intensity exercise may result from epinephrine-induced accumulation of pyruvate (54). Gibala et al. (15) found that of all of the TCA intermediates in skeletal muscle, malate increased to the greatest extent (7.5×) during exercise and contributed the most to the expansion of the pool of TCA intermediates at the end of exercise. By contrast, succinic acid showed the greatest fold change in plasma after exercise in the present study. One explanation for the rise in",peake.txt
374,4,67,"greatest fold change in plasma after exercise in the present study. One explanation for the rise in succinic acid is that carbon skeletons may enter the cycle at the level of 2-oxoglutarate through the alanine aminotransferase reaction, thereby causing accumulation of intermediates in the second span of the TCA cycle (i.e., malate, fumarate, succinate) (15). Typically, TCA intermediates accumulate in skeletal muscle early during exercise and then progressively decline thereafter (18). In the present study, the plasma concentrations of TCA intermediates may therefore have been higher during exercise compared with the end of exercise.",peake.txt
375,4,68,"Most exercise studies have focused on changes in plasma/serum NEFA; comparatively little research has investigated exercise-induced changed in other lipid classes (e.g., phospholipids, mono-, di- or triacylglcerols, diacylglycerols, cholesteryl esters) (44). NEFA represent a relatively small proportion of fatty acids in tissues. Nevertheless, they are important in the context of exercise from both a physiological standpoint (i.e., alterations in the composition of fatty acids delivered to tissues) and a practical perspective (i.e., increasing the likelihood of detecting significant changes) (44). In addition to an increase in total serum NEFA, we detected increases in the plasma concentration of specific NEFA, including myristic acid (C14:0), decanoic acid (C10:0), dodecanoic acid",peake.txt

Myristoleic acid (C14:1) and oleic acid (C18:1n-9) increased only after HIIT, whereas γ-linolenic acid (C18:3) increased only after continuous, moderate-intensity exercise.",peake.txt
377,4,70,"Among the NEFA that increased after exercise in the present study, dodecanoic acid increased to the greatest extent (3.2-fold), palmitoleic acid and myristic acid increased moderately (2.5-fold), and oleic acid increased only slightly (1.3-fold). The percentage molar distribution of these NEFA also increased after exercise (Table 2). Interestingly, with the exception of oleic acid, these NEFA generally comprised <4% of the sum of all NEFA that we measured in plasma. Palmitoleic acid and myristic acid also make up only a small proportion of fatty acids in adipose tissue (23, 29). Changes in plasma fatty acids during exercise represent the balance between fatty acid release from adipose tissue and fatty acid uptake into skeletal muscle and the liver (41). There are several possible",peake.txt
378,4,71,"tissue and fatty acid uptake into skeletal muscle and the liver (41). There are several possible explanations as to why dodecanoic acid, palmitoleic acid, and myristic acid were preferentially mobilized during exercise despite their low relative abundance in plasma and adipose tissue. One possibility is that transport proteins for these particular fatty acids are more abundant in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, and/or they are more sensitive to muscle contractions and hormones. Up to five different fatty acid transport proteins are expressed in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue (20). It is yet to be determined whether these individual proteins transport specific fatty acids. However, the expression or function of specific substrate transporters may be adaptable to alter preferences",peake.txt
379,4,72,the expression or function of specific substrate transporters may be adaptable to alter preferences for certain cellular substrates (20). Another possibility is that the chemical structure of these fatty acids favors a greater ATP yield (relative to O2 demand) during exercise compared with other fatty acids. Further research is needed to examine in more detail why certain fatty acids are mobilized into the circulation to a greater or lesser extent during exercise.,peake.txt
380,4,73,"We observed that the ratio of unsaturated/saturated NEFA in plasma did not change after exercise, which contrasts with other research reporting an increase in this ratio. Mougios et al. (39) reported that the molar distribution of palmitic acid and stearic acid increased, whereas the molar distribution of oleic acid and linoleic acid decreased, after exercise. It is difficult to compare these studies with our results because we measured a greater number of plasma NEFA. Consequently, the ratio of unsaturated/saturated fatty acids was lower in the present study. Nevertheless, we observed that the molar distribution of palmitic acid and stearic acid did not change, oleic acid increased slightly, and linoleic acid decreased slightly (Table 2). The changes in these specific NEFA after exercise",peake.txt

In addition to differences in the number of NEFA that we detected, the variation between our findings and others (39) may be related to the intensity and duration of exercise and the sex and training status of the participants.",peake.txt
382,4,75,"A strength of the present study is that we monitored metabolic changes not only immediately following completion of exercise but additionally during the early hours of recovery from exercise. We found that total serum NEFA remained elevated 2 h after both high-intensity interval exercise and continuous, moderate-intensity exercise. Among the individual fatty acids that we measured in plasma by metabolomics, heptadecenoic acid, dodecanoic acid, myristic acid, oleic acid, and palmitoleic acid were also still elevated 2 h after both exercise trials. Consistent with other studies, there were no significant differences in plasma fatty acid concentrations during recovery from the high-intensity exercise and the continuous moderate-intensity exercise (22, 41). In support of the present study in",peake.txt
383,4,76,"and the continuous moderate-intensity exercise (22, 41). In support of the present study in relation to postexercise lipid metabolism, several studies have found no difference in fat oxidation or respiratory exchange ratio after high-intensity exercise compared with moderate-intensity exercise (30, 31). By contrast, others have reported that fat oxidation was higher while respiratory exchange ratio was lower after high-intensity exercise compared with moderate-intensity exercise (36, 63). These discrepancies may reflect differences between these studies in exercise protocols and the training status of participants. It also remains unclear whether differences in intensity and substrate metabolism during exercise translate to differences in energy expenditure during recovery from exercise",peake.txt

385,4,78,"In the present study, changes in the concentration of NEFA and other specific fatty acids (e.g., dodecanoic acid, myristic acid, palmitoleic acid) remained high for 2 h after exercise. Mulla et al. (41) reported similar changes in NEFA and glycerol output from adipose tissue during and after exercise. Together, these findings reflect a shift in substrate oxidation in favor of lipid metabolism (28, 30). This response may occur to continue supplying energy while facilitating restoration of glucose homeostasis and glycogen restoration (30).",peake.txt
386,4,79,"This is the first study to compare the effects of exercise intensity on changes in a broad range of amino acids in plasma. The plasma concentrations of alanine, glutamate, and tyrosine increased significantly only during high-intensity interval exercise. Furthermore, alanine was significantly higher after high-intensity interval exercise compared with continuous moderate-intensity exercise. Other studies have reported an increase in alanine concentration in both venous plasma (3) and arterial plasma in response to exercise (40, 59). This rise in alanine within the circulation reflects its synthesis and release from skeletal muscle (58).

In contrast with our findings, other studies have reported a decrease (40) or no change (59) in the concentration of glutamate in arterial plasma. In skeletal muscle, glutamate consumption increases markedly during the first few minutes of exercise, particularly when muscle glycogen is low (59). The consumption of glutamate in muscle may shift the alanine aminotransferase reaction in favor of the formation of alanine and TCA intermediates such as α-oxoglutarate (58). We can only speculate,",peake.txt
388,4,81,"the formation of alanine and TCA intermediates such as α-oxoglutarate (58). We can only speculate, but the increase in venous plasma glutamate concentration that we observed may have served to generate more TCA intermediates during high-intensity interval exercise. We detected increases in the plasma concentrations of 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoic acid and 3-methyl-2-oxopentanoic acid after high-intensity intermittent exercise. These carboxylic acids may represent breakdown products of leucine (46).",peake.txt
389,4,82,"The other amino acids that we measured in plasma (i.e., threonine, phenylalanine, glycine, cysteine, proline, and ornithine) did not change significantly during either exercise trial. Some of these amino acids, such as threonine, phenylalanine, and glycine, are not metabolized in skeletal muscle (58), which could explain why they did not change after exercise in this study. It is possible that phenylalanine is converted to tyrosine, which might partially account for the rise in plasma tyrosine concentration that occurred during high-intensity interval exercise.",peake.txt
390,4,83,"During recovery from exercise, branched-chain amino acids, methionine, alanine, and proline were all significantly lower compared with preexercise, particularly after continuous moderate-intensity exercise. This sustained decline in these amino acids during recovery from exercise reflects their role in gluconeogenesis. Wahren et al. (61) provided early evidence that amino acids (particularly alanine), pyruvate and lactate assist in restoring hepatic glucose metabolism after exercise. More recent work by Mourtzakis et al. (40) revealed that efflux of branched-chain amino acid, glutamine, and alanine from skeletal muscle stimulates a significant rise in arterial blood glucose concentration during recovery from exercise.

Despite a difference in plasma glucose concentration after exercise, the plasma concentrations of amino acids during recovery were not significantly between the two exercise trials in the present study.

392,4,85,"We detected an increase in several other metabolic species in plasma, including 2-hydroxybutyric acid, itaconic acid, and citraconic acid, most notably after high-intensity intermittent exercise. These metabolites do not fall into any of the classical metabolic clusters, and relatively little is known about their biological functions, at least in humans. However, 2-hydroxybutyric acid is elevated in urine from patients with lactic acidosis and ketoacidosis (32), which suggests that it plays some sort of role under conditions of metabolic stress. Itaconic acid may be derived from aconitic acid (which is a TCA intermediate), whereas citraconic acid may be a by-product of glutamine metabolism (47).",peake.txt
393,4,86,"We attempted to link intensity-dependent changes in metabolism with specific hormonal responses. ACTH, cortisol, and growth hormone were significantly higher after high-intensity intermittent exercise compared with continuous moderate-intensity exercise. Cortisol and growth hormone play an important role in regulating blood glucose concentration at rest (9, 10), but less so during exercise (11, 26). It seems unlikely that these hormones were solely responsible for the higher plasma glucose concentration after high-intensity intermittent exercise. Catecholamines and IL-6 may also have induced a rise in plasma glucose during exercise (27, 35).

It is possible that ∼1 h exercise was not long enough, and/or the catecholamine response to exercise was not sufficient to induce the release of glucagon (13). Either way, it would appear that glucagon played a minor role (if any) in regulating glucose metabolism during exercise in the present study.",peake.txt
395,4,88,"Cortisol, growth hormone, and catecholamines stimulate lipolysis during exercise (1, 11, 26). However, because the plasma concentrations of NEFA were not significantly different after high-intensity intermittent exercise vs. continuous moderate-intensity exercise, it is difficult to assign a specific role for these hormones in regulating fat metabolism during exercise. At rest, IL-6 induces lipolysis in skeletal muscle (but not adipose tissue) (66), yet its role in regulating lipid metabolism during exercise remains unresolved (62). Cortisol mediates protein metabolism during exercise (11) and could possibly account for the higher plasma alanine concentration after high-intensity intermittent exercise in the present study.",peake.txt
396,4,89,"There were several limitations to the present study. First, we could not determine the precise intensity for high-intensity interval exercise and continuous moderate-intensity exercise that would elicit the greatest difference in CHO and fat metabolism. Second, the short 30-s stages that we employed during the V̇o2 max test may not have provided stable readings to determine relative workloads in an accurate manner. Last, we did not assess the metabolic and hormonal response to individual intervals. The metabolic and hormonal responses over the short period of these intervals may be different compared with that of 40 min of continuous exercise. Because we only reported pre- and postexercise data for both trials, the results of the two exercise trials are not directly comparable.",peake.txt

2.1 Endurance cycling

The endurance cycling event over a distance of 1060 km followed the rules of “Brevets de Randonneurs Mondiaux,” which essentially means that riders were self-supplied and self-supported, without accompanying support crew. Supplies were taken from public places, such as gas stations, restaurants, and supermarkets. The course was not marked or secured, riders were supplied with a map and road directions. The two athletes, male and female, for whom a saliva profile was analyzed throughout the event, were riding on a tandem (Rotor Bikes, Germany). Thus, short rest breaks and food supplies were taken simultaneously. The riders took 62 h to complete the course. A 4-h sleep break was taken after 36 h.

The present study is a case study of the effect of long-lasting endurance workload on composition of salivary protein and metabolite pools. The results and conclusions from our work have pioneer character for individualized salivary diagnostics and can be used as a basis for further, detailed studies on adaptive effects and training effects using higher sample size.

485,5,86,"Although the number of individuals subjected to the detailed profiling analysis in our study was low, we are convinced that general patterns of protein and metabolite abundance changes can well be concluded from this study. The interindividual variability of salivary protein composition was assessed in studying ten different individuals and the intraindividual variability was analyzed from same individuals over multiple days (Fig. 2). The conclusion from this assessment of variability is that comparative quantitation of protein abundances within one individual can well be carried out within an average relative deviation of less than 20%. These findings are in agreement with a recent study of interindividual protein patterns 42, in which the authors of the study also identified a strong",zauber.txt

487,5,88,"Thus, in our present case study, the focus on two individuals who were monitored over a long time period allows to specifically and precisely identify factors that are associated with adaptive responses and diurnal rhythms. Within each individual, specific abundance changes associated with diurnal rhythms, adaption to and regeneration from endurance stress can well be quantified without being dimmed by interindividual variation. Particularly, key results, such as effects of long-lasting endurance workloads on immune response proteins were observed for both individuals independently, suggesting that indeed quantitative analysis on an individual basis is justified. In addition, we could also show that stress-induced adaptive effects can override diurnal abundance variations (Supporting",zauber.txt

The strict criteria we have applied for protein quantitation ensured accurate comparison, but particularly interesting proteins may have been excluded from quantitative analysis, as they were observed only in few of the samples. The criteria applied for quantitation required a protein to be identified in at least 50% of the time points within a physiological phase of rest, stress, or recovery. Thus, by principle, low abundant proteins, and proteins present only in particular time periods were excluded from further quantitative analysis.

WDR13, a member of the Trp–Asp repeat protein family, is hypothesized to be a regulatory protein 48. In both individuals, it displayed a very strong increase in abundance during the stress phase.

However, we could clearly see significant changes in abundance or in diurnal amplitude for those substances that are involved in energy metabolism, such as citric acid, malate, glucose, or creatinine. These substances increased in abundance or decreased in amplitude during the phase of endurance work suggesting an increased metabolic activity to provide energy.

Creatinine is excreted from working muscle cells after energy release from phosphocreatine, the intermediate buffer for activated phosphates. With enduring work, energy supply is shifted more to metabolization of fatty acids and ketobodies with concomitant glucose decrease, mainly controlled by growth hormone 53.

At the central regulatory level, nervous and endocrine system branches act together to mobilize energy compounds and to give priority to their utilization in the working tissues. In return, they also act to protect the body from wear and to assure sufficient regeneration 54. Thus, clearest indication of substantial adaptive processes associated with long-term endurance work could be seen by changes in the cortisol/androstenedione ratio throughout the cycling event and during regeneration phase.

Exceeding several hours of work is accompanied by suppression of immune reactions, repair, and regeneration due to maximum cortisol levels. Phases after long-lasting physical exercise often result in below-rest cortisol levels and several days of inflammatory response 58, 59.

First, the decrease of immune response proteins (Table 2), reflecting the increase in cortisol to androstenedione ratio in the early stress phase, with cortisol having suppressive effects on the immune system 62. Second, the overrepresentation of proteins with functions in redox regulation (Table 3) during the stress phase.

Recently, salicylate was found to be synthesized also in mammals with assumed protective function 64. Its induction therefore might reflect extreme oxidative stress during cycling event studied here, but an influence of intake of acetylsalicylic acid to prevent inflammatory responses at hours 8, 20, and 32 after begin of the endurance cycling cannot be excluded.
