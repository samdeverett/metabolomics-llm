In systems biology, the information and interac-tion of the functional physical structure and the genetic information are integrated toprovide a comprehensive model of the organism (Figure 1). Different high-throughputtechnologies are used to study the genetic program of the various -omics fields: genomics,transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics.Metabolomics was the newest field added to the systems biology toolbox at the begin-ning of the 21st century. Metabolomics gives a quantitative and qualitative overview ofall the metabolites, small molecules with a molecular weight of 30–3000 Da, present in anorganism with various properties and functions [4]. There are approximately 1,000,000 dif-ferent metabolites available in the plant kingdom, which makes metabolomics a challengingfield [5]. Moreover, the metabolome changes quite quickly due to circadian rhythm [6–8]and environmental stresses [9,10] and differs between organs, tissues and even for sin-gle cells [11,12]. The metabolome is most closely related to the phenotype of a plantsince metabolites are the end products of cellular processes [13]. Metabolomics is usedto study development under normal and abiotic conditions (temperature, light, salt) [14]and biotic stress conditions (fungal, insects) [15,16], the safety assessment of geneticallymodified crops [17], speed up crop improvements [18], the effect of fruit storage [19] andthe detection of food fraud [20,21].The link between the gene regulatory network and the functional physical structure(the double arrow in Figure 1) is generally considered highly complex, with many pathwaysand pathway nodes interacting in what are often considered multifactorial processes.
